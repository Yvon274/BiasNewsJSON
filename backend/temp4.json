The union had previously endorsed Biden in 2020.\n\nBiden has already received endorsements from several other major U.S. labor unions, including AFL-CIO, United Auto Workers, and the American Federation of Teachers.\n\n\u201cJoe Biden bet on the American worker, while Donald Trump blamed the American worker,\u201d UAW President Shawn Fain said during his speech in January announcing the union\u2019s endorsement of Biden.

            "text": "Four years after the Covid pandemic sent America into a standstill, President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign is looking to co-opt a common question posed by former President Donald Trump and his allies: \u201cAre you better off than you were four years ago?\u201d\n\nTrump asked his 6.7 million followers on Truth Social that question earlier this week, using it to drive contrasts between Biden and Trump\u2019s records on the economy and the border. But the Biden-Harris campaign plans to highlight key moments from four years ago in an effort to flip the question back onto Trump, seeing a golden opportunity to exploit his handling of the pandemic.\n\nThe Biden campaign made a statement Friday morning highlighting Trump\u2019s pledge four years ago to the day to \u201cterminate\u201d the Affordable Care Act, roughly 10 days after the World Health Organization formally declared Covid a global pandemic.\n\n\u201cFour years ago today, Trump was trying to throw millions of Americans off their insurance while Americans were dying by the thousands of Covid-19, even more Americans were infected, and hospitals were reaching a breaking point,\u201d Biden-Harris senior spokesperson Sarafina Chitika said in a statement.\n\nOn Thursday, the campaign released a digital ad that paired images from the early days of the pandemic with audio of Trump suggesting disinfectant as a treatment, downplaying concerns over the number of Covid-related deaths at the time, and dismissing questions from reporters about his handling of the crisis.\n\nAnd Biden is test-driving the strategy on the stump while speaking at fundraisers in Texas.\n\n\u201cJust a few days ago, he asked the famous question, \u2018Are you better off today than you were yesterday?\u2019 Well, Donald, I\u2019m glad you asked that question,\u201d Biden said during a campaign reception in Houston on Thursday. (The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nBiden pointed to Trump\u2019s handling of the pandemic and a debunked claim that Trump suggested the injection of bleach as a treatment option.\n\n\u201cHe must\u2019ve done it,\u201d Biden joked.\n\nIt comes amid a broader effort by Biden and his campaign to co-opt language made popular by Trump and the Republicans.\n\nIn a bid to highlight that Biden held more campaign events this month than Trump, Biden\u2019s campaign accused the former president of \u201chiding in his basement\u201d \u2014 a line Trump and his allies frequently deployed about Biden in 2020.\n\nThe campaign has also turned \u201cBrandon\u201d \u2014 a code word used by Republicans to insult Biden \u2014 into a kind of internet alter-ego and a core component of his social media branding, launching a \u201cDark Brandon\u201d account on X and releasing several \u201cDark Brandon\u201d-branded memes.\n\nA senior Biden-Harris campaign official told NBC News the campaign will continue to highlight \u201ckey moments from four years ago throughout the month of April.\u201d\n\nThose moments will include headlines reminding voters of rising crime and toilet paper shortages toward the end of Trump\u2019s term and footage reminding voters of the \u201cchaos\u201d of the pandemic in 2020.\n\n\u201cAmericans remember March Madness, proms, weddings, and celebrations being canceled, waiting in line for toilet paper and essentials, businesses shutting down, and losing loved ones \u2014 all because Trump failed to prepare for and then couldn\u2019t lead when we needed him the most,\u201d Biden campaign spokesperson Ammar Moussa said. \u201cThe only thing to happen four years ago to make Americans\u2019 lives better was Donald Trump losing to Joe Biden.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Trump spokesperson Karoline Leavitt cited higher mortgage rates, illegal border crossings, the war in Ukraine and other foreign conflicts to argue the U.S. was better off under Trump prior to Covid-19.\n\n\u201cAmericans know Biden has been a disaster and they were far better off under President Trump, which is why President Trump continues to crush Biden in the polls,\u201d Leavitt said.",

            "text": "Today, the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability held a hearing titled, \u201cInfluence Peddling: Examining Joe Biden\u2019s Abuse of Public Office.\u201d Witnesses included Biden family business associates Tony Bobulinski and Jason Galanis who testified that Joe Biden knew about, participated in, and enabled his family\u2019s corrupt influence peddling schemes that made his family over $24 million. Congresswoman Lauren Boebert (CO-03) said, \u201cJoe Biden has leveraged his elected position to enable the Biden family, their business associates, and their shell companies to receive over $24 million dollars from China and other entities. Biden is compromised and a threat to our national security. It is far past time Congress evict the resident in the White House and hold him accountable for selling out the American people.\u201d Background Courtesy of the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability: Biden family business associates Tony Bobulinski and Jason Galanis testified under oath President Joe Biden actively participated in his family\u2019s corrupt business dealings and acted as the closer for deals with Chinese and Russian entities. Mr. Tony Bobulinski, Biden family business associate: \u201cJoe Biden was more than a participant in and beneficiary of his family\u2019s business; he was an active, aware enabler who met with business associates such as myself to further the business, despite being buffered by a complex scheme to maintain plausible deniability.\u201d Mr. Jason Galanis, Biden family business associate: \u201cDuring the May 4th party, we were told to go to an area of the restaurant to gather because Hunter was going to call his father. Hunter called his father, said hello and \u2018hold on, Pops,\u2019 then put the call on speakerphone and said, \u2018I am here with our friends I told you were coming to town, and we wanted to say hello.\u2019 The Vice President said hello and some pleasantries [\u2026] and then seemed like he wanted to bring the call to an end by saying, \u2018Ok then, you be good to my boy.\u2019 Hunter responded by saying, \u2018Everything is good, and we are moving ahead.\u2019 The Vice President said something about \u2018being helpful,\u2019 and Hunter ended the call by saying that he was going to call his father later. [\u2026] A few days after this May 4th party, an email my lawyer provided to this committee shows that Devon had confirmed Ms. Baturina was committed to a \u2018hard order\u2019 of $10-20 million in a Burnham investment banking client.\u201d The Bidens don\u2019t sell a product or a service or a set of skills. President Joe Biden is \u201cthe brand\u201d that the Biden family is selling for millions of dollars to those around the world willing to pay for it. Mr. Tony Bobulinski: \u201cI want to be crystal clear: from my direct personal experience and what I have subsequently come to learn, it is clear to me that Joe Biden was \u2018the Brand\u2019 being sold by the Biden family. His family\u2019s foreign influence peddling operation \u2013 from China to Ukraine and elsewhere \u2013 sold out to foreign actors who were seeking to gain influence and access to Joe Biden and the United States government. Mr. Jason Galanis: \u201cThe entire value-add of Hunter Biden to our business was his family name and his access to his father, Vice President Joe Biden.\u201d House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-Ky.): \u201cThe scam is simple. It\u2019s done over and over again. The Biden family promises Joe\u2019s power, Joe Biden shows up, and millions of dollars come into the Bidens\u2019 pockets. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio): \u201cMillions of dollars from foreign entities run through twenty different companies, for what? Devon Archer told us what it was for: Access to the brand. And the brand was Joe Biden. The brand that played rounds of golf, took calls and meetings, attended lunches and dinners with Hunter Biden and his business partners.\u201d Hunter Biden failed to appear alongside his business associates today because his testimony would not withstand public scrutiny when held up against witness facts and evidence uncovered showing Joe Biden\u2019s involvement in the business schemes. Hunter for months has requested a public hearing, but when offered one alongside his business associates, he failed to show up. Mr. Bobulinski: \u201cHow are the American people supposed to get the unvarnished facts and truth when the son and brother of Joe Biden are willing to perjure themselves to protect the family?\u201d President Joe Biden continues to lie directly to the American people about the central role he played in his family\u2019s corrupt influence peddling schemes. Mr. Tony Bobulinski: \u201cWhy is Joe Biden blatantly lying to the American people? Why has he not simply leveled with the American people about all of the meetings, phone calls, emails and handshakes he has had with the Biden family\u2019s U.S. and foreign business partners, including players from some of America\u2019s most challenging adversaries such as China and Russia, as well as Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Romania and others. If he were doing nothing wrong, why go through this insane exercise of obstructing and denying obvious facts?\u201d The House Committee on Oversight and Accountability released a video exposing Joe Biden\u2019s repeated lies about his family\u2019s influence peddling business. The video uses new footage from recent transcribed interviews with key witnesses who testified today. ###",

            "text": "President Biden\u2019s reelection campaign is eyeing North Carolina as a state to flip in 2024, a place where former President Trump barely eked out a win the last time the two went head-to-head.\n\nWhile the Biden campaign acknowledges it will \u201ctake relentless effort\u201d to reach every voter it can by November, the Tar Heel State is seen as an opportunity, especially given a gubernatorial race that could boost Biden.\n\nBut strategists question how feasible that goal is, given the state hasn\u2019t gone to a Democrat since 2008 and went to Trump in his last two White House bids.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still aspirational, but the state is definitely in play,\u201d said GOP strategist Doug Heye. \u201cTrump should win it. If I were betting on it, I would bet Trump would win.\u201d\n\nNorth Carolina is part of the Biden campaign\u2019s pathway-to-270 strategy through critical swing states, which include the so-called blue wall made up of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin; western battlegrounds including Nevada and Arizona; and southern states such as Georgia and North Carolina.\n\nNorth Carolina is included as part of a $30 million six-week advertising blitz the campaign announced after the State of the Union address to spend big in battleground states. Biden recently did radio interviews around Super Tuesday in Fayetteville and Charlotte to reach Black North Carolinians, one of several voting factions key to another victory.\n\nBiden and Vice President Harris will travel to North Carolina on March 26 as part of their effort to travel to every battleground state in March.\n\n\u201cNorth Carolinians know that while President Biden is fighting for us, Donald Trump is fighting for billionaires, corporations, and an extreme agenda that hurts our families and our economy,\u201d Biden campaign\u2019s North Carolina communications director Dory MacMillan told The Hill. \u201cOur campaign will continue to communicate across every corner of this state to reject Trump\u2019s attacks on our families and earn four more years of progress with President Biden.\u201d\n\nThe campaign currently has a $155 million war chest, but aside from spending and infrastructure, a major factor that strategists say can help Biden in the Tar Heel State is the governor\u2019s race, which includes far-right Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson on the ballot.\n\n\u201cGiven the very weak Republican gubernatorial candidate in North Carolina and a very sophisticated operation from the Democratic candidate, the Biden team will have an even better opportunity to win there this time around because of the demographic shifts and a robust coordinated campaign in a state he barely lost,\u201d said Michael LaRosa, first lady Jill Biden\u2019s traveling press secretary during the 2020 campaign.\n\nMike Lonergan, the communications director for Mark Robinson for Governor, criticized Biden and Robinson\u2019s Democratic opponent Josh Stein in a statement to The Hill, saying Stein \u201cstands with President Biden\u2019s open-borders policies and would turn North Carolina into a sanctuary state for illegal immigrants; and he\u2019s backed by far-left radicals that want to defund the police.\u201d\n\nThe statement continued, \u201cThe Democrats will stop at nothing to smear Mark Robinson because they know North Carolina voters have had enough of extremism and lies from career politicians like Joe Biden and Josh Stein.\u201d\n\nTrump barely beat Biden in North Carolina last time around by less than 1 percentage point. The last Democrat to win the state in a presidential contest was then-Democratic nominee Barack Obama, but he lost his reelection bid there to 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney by 2 percentage points. Trump won the state when he ran for the White House the first time in 2016, beating Hillary Clinton by nearly 4 points.\n\nAn aggregation of polls shows Trump with a 7.4 point lead over Biden in North Carolina, a wider lead than the former president has managed in other battleground states.\n\n2024 could prove to be a split-ticket situation in North Carolina, where Democratic gubernatorial nominee Josh Stein wins while Trump takes the state, considering that when Trump won the state in 2020, Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper was reelected to a second term.\n\nThe GOP nominee for superintendent, who would oversee the public schools in North Carolina, is also troubling to some moderate Republicans. Social media posts have emerged of Michele Morrow calling for former President Obama to be publicly executed, CNN reported.\n\nGiven the slate of Republican candidates, Democrats believe pouring efforts into North Carolina is a good idea.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a smart bet,\u201d said Ivan Zapien, former official at the Democratic National Committee. \u201cThe Republicans have nominated some down-ballot candidates that are not going to do well in the suburbs, assuming the suburbs perform like they have been performing [in] the last cycles. It\u2019s ripe for a pickup.\u201d\n\nStill, Democrats acknowledge it\u2019s an uphill battle.\n\n\u201cNorth Carolina is ripe to flip, but it\u2019s still North Carolina,\u201d LaRosa said.\n\nRepublicans like Heye, a North Carolina native, say the state\u2019s not a forgone conclusion given its demographic developments.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an outside chance that the Democrats take it because of the closeness of the state, because of the fast growth in the state, particularly in two parts \u2014 Charlotte and Raleigh and their suburban areas,\u201d he said.\n\nGrowth in areas like Charlotte and Raleigh has comprised an uptick in young, professional, suburban women, who helped give Democrats better-than-expected results in 2022 after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.\n\nBlack voters are also a pivotal voting bloc in North Carolina, which is home to 11 historically Black colleges and universities.\n\nJim Kessler, executive vice president for policy at Third Way, compared North Carolina to Georgia, a state that helped push Biden over the edge in 2020 in large part because of support from Black voters.\n\n\u201cThey each have a growing share of college-educated voters that have become essential for Democrats. Georgia has more African American voters, which proved to be the difference in 2020, but North Carolina is starting to look like the kind of state where Democrats should prevail,\u201d he said.\n\nThis story was updated at 8:57 p.m.\n\nFOLLOW US ON GOOGLE NEWS\n\nRead original article here",

            "text": "President Joe Biden announced another round of student loan debt forgiveness Thursday, totaling $5.8 billion for nearly 78,000 public-sector workers, and will be sending congratulatory emails to those borrowers next week.\n\nAdditionally, 380,000 borrowers who may be eligible for debt relief within the next one or two years will also be getting emails from Biden with a message that says \u201ckeep it up!\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you continue your career in public service, you\u2019re on track to get your eligible student loans forgiven in less than two years through Public Service Loan Forgiveness,\u201d an example email provided by the White House reads.\n\nUnder the forgiveness program, known as PSLF, qualifying borrowers \u2013 like teachers, social workers, some nurses and doctors, and government lawyers \u2013 are eligible for student debt cancellation after making 10 years of monthly payments.\n\nThe emails come as the Biden administration is eager to remind voters in an election year about how it has approved more student debt cancellation than under any other president \u2013 despite the fact that the Supreme Court knocked down its broad student loan forgiveness program last year.\n\nThat program would have canceled up to $20,000 for low- and middle-income borrowers, for an estimated total of $430 billion of debt relief.\n\nInstead, the Biden administration has canceled a total of $144 billion of federal student loan debt for nearly 4 million borrowers to date, mostly through existing student loan forgiveness programs that target specific groups of borrowers.\n\nBiden started sending emails to borrowers who are getting student loan forgiveness last month when it announced a round of debt relief worth about $1.2 billion. Borrowers who received debt forgiveness previously may not have gotten an email from Biden.\n\nPSLF was created by Congress in 2007 but was plagued with administrative problems before Biden took office. Just 7,000 people had ever received debt relief under the program previously, according to the White House.\n\nIn 2021, Biden put a temporary waiver in place, expanding eligibility so that some borrowers could retroactively receive credit for past payments that did not otherwise qualify for PSLF.\n\nThe Biden administration is also conducting a one-time recount of borrowers\u2019 past payments to fix what officials have called \u201cpast administrative failures.\u201d The agency expects to complete the recount by July.\n\nGenerally, the recount will give borrowers credit toward forgiveness for any months in which they made payments regardless of what repayment plan they were enrolled in at the time, according to the Department of Education. The recount especially helps borrowers who may have been inappropriately steered by their student loan servicing company into a long-term forbearance, a period in which they stopped making payments.\n\nWhat Biden has been doing \u2013 before and after the Supreme Court ruling \u2013 is using existing student loan forgiveness programs to deliver relief to certain groups of borrowers.\n\nThe borrower defense to repayment program delivers relief to borrowers who were defrauded by their college, for example. The Biden administration also made discharges automatic for borrowers who are totally and permanently disabled.\n\nAdditionally, nearly 153,000 borrowers have been granted student loan forgiveness so far under Biden\u2019s new income-driven repayment program known as SAVE (Saving on a Valuable Education). Under that plan, remaining federal student loan balances are erased for those who originally borrowed $12,000 or less and have made payments for at least 10 years.\n\nNone of these programs expire, meaning they will help qualifying borrowers now and in the future.",

CNBC\n\nDonald Trump on Saturday told his many online followers, \u201cI LOVE TRUTH SOCIAL\u201d \u2014 but shareholders in the newly merged company that will own that social media app might not feel so great after a sharp drop in price the day before. The shell company Digital World Acquisition Corp. saw its share price plunge nearly 14% in the hours following shareholder approval Friday morning of a merger with the former president\u2018s social media company to take it public. If that drop accelerates in the coming weeks, the value of Trump\u2019s majority stake in the newly merged company, dubbed Trump Media, could be a bit lower than the $3 billion or so estimated before shareholders signed off on the deal Friday. DWAC\u2019s stock, which hit a 52-week-high of $58.72 per share on Jan. 23 as the long-stalled merger appeared more likely to happen, had fallen to $44.20 per share as trading opened Friday morning just ahead of the shareholder vote. DWAC shares closed trading Friday afternoon at $36.94 per share. After-hours trading saw the stock recover a bit to $38.55 per share. But that was still 12.7% lower than Friday\u2019s opening price.\n\nThe decline could reflect concerns about whether Trump Media & Technology Group, which is being merged with DWAC, can ultimately deliver significant revenue \u2014 and whether Trump will try to cash in on his share early because of his many legal problems. TMTG, which owns the Trump Social platform that Trump used Saturday to proclaim his love for the app, reported losses of nearly $50 million over the first three financial quarters of 2023. It booked less than $3.5 million in revenue during that time.\n\nRead more CNBC politics coverage",

            "text": "A coalition of 16 Republican states, led by Texas and Louisiana, filed a lawsuit against the Biden administration, challenging its recent climate action pausing proposed energy projects.\n\nThe multistate coalition filed its complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana, listing President Biden, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm and the Department of Energy (DOE) among the defendants in the case. According to the complaint, the DOE\u2019s move earlier this year pausing major liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminal projects violated long-standing federal energy laws.\n\n\u201cBiden\u2019s unilateral decree disregards statutory mandates, flouts the legal process, upends the oil and gas industry, disrupts the Texas economy, and subverts our constitutional structure,\u201d said Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton.\n\n\u201cThe ban will drive billions of dollars in investment away from Texas, hinder our ability to maximize revenue for public schools, force Texas producers to flare excess natural gas instead of taking it to market, and annihilate critical jobs,\u201d he continued. \u201cI will not stand by while Biden attacks Texas.\u201d\n\nGOP LEADERS CONFRONT BIDEN\u2019S NEW CLIMATE CZAR ON KEY SECURITY RISKS LURKING IN GREEN AGENDA\n\nAccording to Paxton, the LNG export moratorium is unconstitutional, ignores the 1938 Natural Gas Act\u2019s \u201cpresumption in favor of exports\u201d and discards decades of DOE energy policy.\n\nIn arguing the alleged unconstitutionality of the policy, the states\u2019 complaint notes Article I of the Constitution vests Congress with \u201c[a]ll legislative Powers,\u201d including the power \u201c[t]o regulate Commerce with foreign Nations.\u201d Therefore, since blocking LNG exports can be considered a regulation of commerce, the DOE violated the Constitution, according to the lawsuit.\n\nTIKTOK ACTIVIST SAYS HE ADVISED WHITE HOUSE ON BIDEN\u2019S NEW NATURAL GAS MORATORIUM\n\n\u201cThe LNG Export Ban implicates an issue of profound national importance. LNG exports account for billions of dollars to the economy and thousands of jobs,\u201d the complaint states. \u201cThey also raise serious questions of national security. And this is an issue that has been the subject of proposed legislation and public attention in and outside of Congress.\u201d\n\nThe complaint accuses DOE of violating the Administrative Procedure Act which governs the procedures of administrative law. The states highlight that DOE failed to host any public comment period before finalizing its LNG policy without \u201cgood cause to forego the notice and comment requirement.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, the states argue the DOE failed to properly consider the Natural Gas Act and its provision that states the agency issue an export license before hearing from the public.\n\nDOZENS OF FORMER TOP FEDERAL OFFICIALS CALL ON CONGRESS TO STRIKE DOWN BIDEN\u2019S NATURAL GAS CRACKDOWN\n\n\u201cThe Biden administration\u2019s illegal attacks on American energy jeopardizes the livelihoods of thousands of hard-working Louisiana men and women, millions of dollars in tax revenue, and billions of dollars in infrastructure,\u201d said Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill.\n\n\u201cLNG continues to have an enormous positive economic impact for our state \u2014 especially on our hard-hit coastal communities, which continue to recover from a recent series of devastating hurricanes. Jobs like these grow the economy, reduce crime, and help address the out-migration problem,\u201d she continued. \u201cThe people of Louisiana are proud to power this nation. I\u2019m ready to fight for them.\u201d\n\nIn a surprise move in January, Biden ordered the DOE to pause pending permits for LNG export facilities while federal officials conduct a rigorous environmental review assessing the projects\u2019 carbon emissions, which could take more than a year to complete. The action was lauded by climate activists who have loudly called for such a move, which they said would help combat global warming.\n\nHowever, the move was blasted by industry groups, former federal officials and bipartisan lawmakers, who noted energy exports are vital for aiding allies in Europe and Asia. In the aftermath of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine two years ago, U.S. LNG largely filled the void left by Russian natural gas as U.S. allies sought to wean off Russian exports and punish the nation\u2019s economy, a plan Biden endorsed at the time.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",

            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe White House defended its response to the asylum seeker influx facing New York Friday, arguing that without congressional action, the administration is limited in what it can do, following a letter from New York Gov. Kathy Hochul urging more action.\n\nThe growing number of migrants at the US-Mexico border has posed a steep challenge for the Biden administration. It\u2019s a delicate issue for a White House dogged by fierce criticism from the left and right over its handling of the US southern border and remains a political vulnerability amid Republican attacks as the 2024 presidential election approaches and Democratic local officials face pressures at home.\n\nHochul\u2019s announcement this week is the latest salvo in the ongoing migrant saga that has bedeviled local and state officials struggling to navigate the crisis that they have said needs a more robust federal response. \u201cThe reality is we\u2019ve managed thus far without substantive support from Washington,\u201d Hochul said in an address from Albany Thursday.\n\nIn a letter to the White House, Hochul urged Biden to take executive action to expedite work authorizations for asylum seekers, provide more financial aid to the city and the state and make more federal land available to house migrants, among other asks.\n\nIn what may have been her most direct call for assistance, Hochul said she and New York City Mayor Eric Adams have been sounding the alarm for expedited work authorization for migrants and additional federal funds to manage the crisis since July 2022.\n\n\u201cIn our first meeting with the President, Mayor Adams and I have championed the idea of a federal designation that would allow the individuals already here in New York, the ability to work to support themselves and their families,\u201d Hochul said. \u201cThe mayor and I said that and in countless meetings with Congress, the White House, Cabinet members and rallies with labor, press conferences and working with business. What we\u2019ve said all along is just let them work and help us out financially.\u201d\n\nNew York City has been the recipient of millions of dollars in federal funding to address the growing number of migrant arrivals. The administration also expects over $100 million of that support to be made available in the coming weeks.\n\nThe process for applying for asylum and a work permit is based on current immigration laws \u2013 and in recent years, has been made more difficult because of an immense backlog. Immigrant advocates argue that the Biden administration should expand the number of Venezuelans \u2013 who make up many of the migrant arrivals in New York \u2013 eligible for a form of humanitarian-relief known as Temporary Protected Status. That, they say, is perhaps the easiest form of action, without congressional action, the administration could take to satisfy the ask from New York. The Department of Homeland Security secretary has discretion to designate a country for TPS.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, a White House spokesperson said: \u201cWithout Congressional action, this Administration has been working to build a safe, orderly, and humane immigration system and has worked to identify ways to improve efficiencies and maximize the resources the federal government can provide to communities across the country to support the flow of migrants.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will continue to partner with communities across the country to ensure they can receive the support they need. Only Congress can provide additional funding for these efforts, which this Administration has already requested, and only Congress can fix the broken immigration system,\u201d the spokesperson added.\n\nTom Perez, the director of the White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, recently spent time in New York to try to smooth over tensions over the migrant crisis and coordinate with state and city partners, according to multiple sources. And DHS dispatched an assessment team to work with state and local officials, according to an administration official.\n\nTensions rise in New York\n\nThe situation has also caused a divide between Hochul and the Adams\u2019 administrations, with the mayor having previously asked for asylum seekers to be sent to other municipalities throughout the state, not just stay in New York City.\n\n\u201cAlthough we\u2019re disappointed that the state today appears to minimize the role that they can \u2013 and must \u2013 play in responding to this crisis, the state must fulfil its duty to more than 8 million of the state\u2019s residents who call New York City home,\u201d Adams said in a press release Thursday afternoon.\n\n\u201cWhatever differences we all may have about how to handle this crisis; we believe what is crystal clear is that whatever obligations apply under state law to the City of New York apply with equal force to every county across New York state. Leaving New York City alone to manage this crisis \u2013 and abdicating the state\u2019s responsibility to coordinate a statewide response \u2013 is unfair to New York City residents who also didn\u2019t ask to be left almost entirely on their own in the middle of a national crisis.\u201d\n\nHochul, meanwhile, has been steadfast in saying she would not use her executive powers to force other counties to take in asylum seekers, citing the city\u2019s right-to-shelter law, which has been the backdrop of an ongoing legal back-and-forth between the city and the state.\n\n\u201cThis is an agreement that does not apply to the state\u2019s other 57 counties, which is one of the reasons we cannot and will not force other parts of our state to shelter migrants,\u201d Hochul said. \u201cNor are we going to be asking migrants to move to other parts of the state against their will.\u201d\n\nShe said that the state is working with the Department of Labor to connect migrants with jobs once the federal government approves their work authorizations. There have been 2600 families that have applied for asylum over the past 7 weeks, according to New York State Homeland Security Commissioner Jackie Bray. In a survey from this past May, 10% of people being sheltered have previously applied for asylum, Bray said.\n\nHochul said the plan, which hinges on asylum seekers being allowed to work, would help the migrant crisis, as well as businesses, which have struggled to find people to work.\n\n\u201cThis is a national and a federal issue, but New York has shouldered this burden for far too long,\u201d Hochul said.",

Biden meanwhile spent $6.3 million in the month but Trump spent more \u2014 $7.8 million.\n\nThose figures however don\u2019t show the complete picture for either candidate as filings from their various fundraising committees won\u2019t be made until April.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign said at the weekend that it had raised more than $53 million in February, leaving it with a \u201chistoric\u201d total of $155 million, which it said was the most by any Democrat at this stage in the election cycle.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Dumpster fire\u2019 \u2013\n\nPerhaps the most worrying element for Trump are his giant legal fees, as he faces criminal cases including for trying to subvert his 2020 election loss and keeping secret documents.\n\nLawyers\u2019 bills accounted for a huge $5.6 million of the money spent in February by Trump\u2019s Save America political action committee \u2014 money that could otherwise be going towards campaigning and TV spots.\n\nThe figures add to Trump\u2019s woes as he struggles to raise a $464 million bond to appeal a fine by a New York court for fraudulently inflating his wealth.\n\nThe 77-year-old now faces having his assets seized in a humiliating blow to his carefully cultivated image as a dealmaker and self-made tycoon.\n\nTrump cast the fraud case as a \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d seeking as he often does to use the legal cases against him to whip up his supporters \u2014 and get them to open their wallets.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m calling on ONE MILLION Pro-Trump patriots to chip in and say: STOP THE WITCH HUNT AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP!\u201d a campaign message on Wednesday said.\n\nThe message was titled \u201cKEEP YOUR FILTHY HANDS OFF TRUMP TOWER,\u201d his flagship New York property that could be at risk from the court case.\n\nEarlier this month Trump managed to put together a separate bond for $91.6 million as he appeals a sexual assault and defamation judgment in a lawsuit brought by New York writer E. Jean Carroll.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign described Trump\u2019s finances as a \u201cdumpster fire.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s filings paint a bleak picture for Republicans,\u201d Biden campaign spokesman Ammar Moussa wrote on Thursday.\n\nBut with a tight election looming and Trump leading Biden in key swing states in recent polls, Democrats will be trying to keep their war chest as full as possible.\n\nBiden will be joined at a fundraiser in New York on March 28 by Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, the first event of its kind to feature three Democratic presidents and among the most lucrative in party history.\n\nThe gala show is set to raise $10 million for Biden\u2019s campaign, with guests having to fork out $100,000 each to pose in a photo with the 42nd, 44th and 46th US presidents, NBC News reported.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

Far worse than anything Obama did. Far worse than anything Clinton did. This is a whole-of-government attack against our Second Amendment rights.\"\n\nBut even if Chicago did this on its own, its approach to violent crime has been wrongheaded for years.\n\nLast August Alderwoman Maria Hadden proposed to make it illegal to shoot firearms in the city between 9am and 9pm, but during the other 12 hours fire at will.\n\nWhen Chicagoans thought former Mayor Lori Lightfoot was a train wreck, they replaced her with Johnson \u2014 who made Lightfoot look like Ronald Reagan by comparison.\n\nAt about the same time Hadden called for a daily shooting timeout, Johnson cautioned reporters to avoid using the word \"mob\" to describe gangs of felons, and suggested \"gathering\" might be better. If we don\u2019t hurt their feelings maybe they\u2019ll end their lawbreaking ways.\n\nAnd while Lightfoot eliminated 614 officers from the Chicago Police Department, Johnson\u2019s budget slashed another 833 as of January, compounding the problem of inadequate police protection.\n\nTo top it off, last month Johnson opted not to renew the city\u2019s contract to lease ShotSpotter, an audio surveillance system that alerts law enforcement to the location of gunshots fired within the city.\n\nWhile the system was an important law enforcement tool by targeting gunshots, Johnson thought it unfairly targeted minorities.\n\nA government\u2019s ultimate responsibility is to protect the citizens to whom it owes an allegiance. That includes giving them the means to protect themselves \u2014 not taking it away.\n\nBut Chicago\u2019s answer to its crime problem is to cut down its police force, get rid of its high-tech law enforcement tools, and sue Glock, a lawful company manufacturing a lawful product for law-abiding citizens to use for self-protection.\n\nAnd Johnson also wonders why Chicagoans are fleeing the city.\n\nMichael Dorstewitz is a retired lawyer and has been a frequent contributor to Newsmax.

            "text": "With Donald Trump leading in many of the polls for the upcoming US presidential election, his comments about global security and foreign policy have to be taken seriously.\n\nIn February, Trump flippantly remarked that he would encourage Russia to do whatever it wanted to Nato states that failed to pay their bills. In a follow-up interview on GB News this week he warned allies \u201cnot to take advantage\u201d of the US.\n\nNowhere is this causing more concern than for the countries in the Baltic states \u2013 Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.\n\nNot only does Trump, sometimes, say he wants to halt all US military aid to Ukraine, but Trump wants to undercut article 5 of Nato\u2019s treaty \u2013 the principle of collective defence \u2013 something that has become increasingly important in the wake of Russia\u2019s aggression. British military sources are worried that Trump\u2019s remarks will strengthen Putin\u2019s resolve over Ukraine, and could result in him advancing on even more territory.\n\nEven before Trump emerged on the US political scene, the Baltic countries have been especially concerned about Russia\u2019s growing ambitions. They have, after all, been invaded and occupied by Russia before, in 1940, and then forced to become part of the Soviet Union. There\u2019s plenty of people who can still remember life in the Soviet Union.\n\nSince Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea in 2014, the Baltic states have been the loudest voices sounding the alarm about the existential threat posed by Russia, and all three countries increased their military spending to more than 2 per cent of their GDP, and recently agreed to raise it to 3 per cent.\n\nAmid growing security concerns, the defence ministers in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia also agreed in January to set up a common Baltic defence zone on their borders with Russia and Belarus. This would consist of building physical defensive structures such as bunkers.\n\nEstonia will begin construction of 600 bunkers in early 2025. The nations will also cooperate in developing missile artillery, and ensuring that their equipment, ammunition and manpower is updated.\n\nEstonia has also doubled the size of its territorial defence force to 20,000 people, while Latvia reintroduced conscription in 2023 after becoming the only Baltic state to stop mandatory military service in 2006.\n\nLatvia also plans to double the size of its armed forces to 61,000 by the year 2032. Meanwhile, Lithuania has made an agreement with Germany to allow a permanent brigade of 4,800 of its troops to be combat ready on the Russian border by 2027.\n\nBut given that Russia borders 14 countries, why are the Baltic states especially concerned about their security? In addition to being geographically close, a notable number of ethnic Russians live in the Baltic countries (5per cent in Lithuania; 25per cent in Estonia and 36per cent in Latvia. In the eastern Estonian city of Narva, 95.7per cent of the population are native Russian speakers and 87.7per cent are ethnic Russians.\n\nThis matters as Putin has argued that having substantial numbers of ethnic Russians living outside of Russia, due to the \u201ccatastrophic\u201d dissolution of the Soviet Union, represents a \u201chumanitarian disaster of epic proportions\u201d as it left Russians cut off from \u201ctheir motherland\u201d. Putin has vowed to actively protect all \u201cRussians\u201d living abroad.\n\nIn particular, Putin has said he was concerned about how ethnic Russians are being treated in the Baltics, remarking that the deportation of ethnic Russians (most notably in Latvia where there have been recent changes to its immigration laws), poses a threat to Russian national security.\n\nThe Kremlin has also protested the demolition of Soviet monuments in the Baltics, placing Estonia\u2019s prime minster, Kaja Kallas, on its wanted list for doing so.\n\nBut these claims about wanting to protect Russians abroad, are really just a pretext to justify escalation with the Baltics, which will test Nato\u2019s alliance and destabilise the organisation. So it\u2019s not just important that there are ethnic Russians living there \u2013 there are strategic reasons as well that make them an easy target.\n\nEven with the Baltic countries strengthening their troop numbers, Russia currently has 1.32 million active military personnel, and two million active reserve. Combined this is greater that Lithuania\u2019s entire population of 2.8 million people, and far greater than Estonia and Latvia which have populations of 1.3 million and 1.8 million people, respectively.\n\nFor Lithuania, which borders Belarus and Russian-run mini-state Kaliningrad, there are concerns that it could be taken over first by Russian forces, which would then physically isolate Lithuania from the rest of the Baltics. The Kaliningrad region has become increasingly militarised in recent years, with Iskander ballistic missiles and S-400 systems installed. With Trump suggesting he would weaken the US\u2019s commitment to Nato if elected, there won\u2019t be much of a deterrent for Putin to grab low-hanging fruit.\n\nThe current Nato response force consists of approximately 40,000 troops, with plans to upgrade to 300,000 troops. But quick-reaction units could still be too slow to protect the Baltics from Russian forces as, ironically, moving large units, vehicles and ammunition across borders is bureaucratic and takes time. It would be important to have excellent intelligence and to move quickly, something that will be made more difficult with the US potentially opting out of its commitments.\n\nThough Russia has plunged much of its resources into winning the Ukraine war, Putin still aims to expand Russian sovereignty across the post-Soviet states and to effectively dismantle Nato, something that Trump takes no issue with. As Russia has been ramping up its war machine, the Baltic states firmly believe that Russian aggression will not stop at Ukraine, and that they could be next.

            "text": "NYC Mayor\u2019s Filthy Closet Swings Open \u2013 New Details on His Alleged Crime Revealed\n\nOne of the darlings of the Democrat party was hit with allegations and a lawsuit about his behavior from decades ago. The sordid details fell out of this politician\u2019s closet and sent shockwaves through the ranks of liberals.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump was politically crucified over allegations of his past personal conduct. Anything said accusing him was largely treated by the liberal media as truth and he was guilty in the eyes of mainstream media no matter what truth was revealed.\n\nNow the shoe is on the other foot for liberals as New York City Mayor Eric Adams was hammered by an allegation of sexual assault by an unidentified woman. Questions are swirling if he will receive the same treatment as the former president.\n\nFrom Breitbart:\n\nAs Breitbart News reported in November 2023, an unidentified woman filed a lawsuit against the mayor, alleging he sexually assaulted her while the two were working together in 1993. On Monday, the New York Times reported that Adams allegedly \u201casked a colleague for oral sex in exchange for career help in 1993 and sexually assaulted her when she refused.\u201d\n\nThe events in question allegedly happened while the plaintiff and Adams worked together at New York City\u2019s transit police bureau. The woman claimed that she feared for her life at the time due to Adams\u2019 then-status as a police officer with a loaded gun.\n\nAdams denied the allegation, and in December said the incident, \u201cNever happened. I don\u2019t even know who the person is. I don\u2019t even remember if I ever met them before.\u201d\n\nThat is a strong denial that sounds very much like Trump\u2019s response to allegations against him. Denials didn\u2019t work out well for Trump as he lost one case that is costing him tens of millions of dollars in judgments.\n\nAdams\u2019 case brings up many questions similar to cases against Trump. What is the validity of the plaintiff\u2019s claims? Will the media attack Adams, a fellow liberal, like they did Trump? Will Adams face a hostile judge and jury in New York?\n\nAdams\u2019 accuser is also seeking damages against the New York Police Department\u2019s (NYPD) transit bureau and the Guardians Association \u2014 a fraternal organization of Black police officers that Adams was active in at the time. All are named as defendants.\n\nThe credibility of the plaintiff\u2019s accusations will likely be considered going forward. The New York Times reported that the woman, who lives in Florida, previously filed lawsuits in the past that were unsuccessful. These included failed lawsuits against American Airlines in 2008 and the Miami-Dade County Public Schools Board in 2009.\n\nThe woman\u2019s lawyer, Megan Goddard, said in a statement that the woman filed the suit out of a belief to hold sexual abusers to account.\n\nThere hasn\u2019t been the same fury toward Adams in this case that was hurled at Trump in his legal challenges. Adams, who has been under fire for his immigration policies and disagreements with Joe Biden, likely won\u2019t face the same media firestorm as Trump. How Adams\u2019 case plays out is anyone\u2019s guess.\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\nMore details were revealed in a lawsuit against NYC Mayor Eric Adams.\n\nAn unidentified woman alleged that Adams sexually assaulted her.\n\nThe lawsuit alleged that the assault occurred more than 30 years ago.\n\nSource: Breitbart",

            "text": "We\u2019re getting right to the nub now.\n\nThis week the World Meteorological Organization officially certified 2023 as the hottest year in human history. Just to put on the record here what should have been the lead story in every journal and website on our home planet:\n\nAndrea Celeste Saulo, secretary general of the WMO, said the organisation was now \u201csounding the red alert to the world.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe report found temperatures near the surface of the earth were 1.45\u00b0C higher last year than they were in the late 1800s, when people began to destroy nature at an industrial scale and burn large amounts of coal, oil, and gas.\n\n\n\nLast year\u2019s spike was so scary that NASA\u2019s Gavin Schmidt\u2014Jim Hansen\u2019s heir as keeper of NASA\u2019s climate record\u2014wrote in Nature this week that it raised the most profound possible implications. Please read his words slowly and carefully:\n\nIt could imply that a warming planet is already fundamentally altering how the climate system operates, much sooner than scientists had anticipated. It could also mean that statistical inferences based on past events are less reliable than we thought, adding more uncertainty to seasonal predictions of droughts and rainfall patterns.\n\n\n\nMuch of the world\u2019s climate is driven by intricate, long-distance links\u2014known as teleconnections\u2014fuelled by sea and atmospheric currents. If their behavior is in flux or markedly diverging from previous observations, we need to know about such changes in real time.\n\n\n\nAnd now, with equal care, read the words of the biggest oil producer on earth, the CEO of Saudi Aramco, who was in Houston last week for the annual hydrocarbon festival known as CERAWeek.\n\nWe should abandon the fantasy of phasing out oil and gas and instead invest in them adequately reflecting realistic demand assumptions.\n\n\n\nThat is to say, the powers that be want to abandon what the World Meteorological Organization, in their \u201cred alert\u201d report called the \u201cone glimmer of hope\u201d: that renewable energy installations rose 50% last year.\n\nUnderstand that the battle is fully joined. The fossil fuel industry\u2014as Exxon CEO Darren Woods helpfully explained\u2014is in an all-out fight to derail anything green, because it won\u2019t return \u201cabove average profits.\u201d They have plenty of allies: Everyone noted former President Donald Trump threatening a \u201cbloodbath\u201d last week, but fewer noted the actual target of his wrath: electric vehicles. The Biden administration, after listening to the rhetoric at the Houston conference, backed EVs in a straightforward and earnest way today, announcing new rules that attempt to spur the rapid growth of a crucial climate-fighting technology. But of course that produced the requisite reaction: as The New York Timesreported:\n\nThe American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, a lobbying organization, has started what it says is a \u201cseven figure\u201d campaign of advertising, phone calls, and text messages against what it falsely calls \u201cBiden\u2019s E.P.A. car ban\u201d in the swing states Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada, and Arizona, as well as in Ohio, Montana, and the Washington D.C. market.\n\n\n\nSo, like it or not, the climate crisis is going to be a key part of this election campaign. The November outcome may hinge on whether Americans can imagine making even this small change in the face of the gravest crisis our species has ever wandered into: replacing the gas tank in a car with a battery. That doesn\u2019t seem like much to ask?\n\nIt won\u2019t solve the climate crisis, of course\u2014nothing will solve it. But accelerating momentum towards green energy is the likeliest card we have to play in a world where people seem unwilling to moderate their demands for mobility, and indeed for consumption of any kind.\n\nOne particularly depressing set of statistics about that ever-increasing demand for more emerged last week, as the energy implications of artificial intelligence started to become clearer. Here\u2019s what Bloombergreported on Wednesday:\n\nJohn Ketchum, CEO of utility NextEra Energy Inc., told attendees that U.S. power demand, which has been relatively flat for years, is poised to increase by 81% over the next five years. Toby Rice, chief of the largest U.S. natural gas driller, EQT Corp., cited a prediction that AI will gobble up more power domestically than households by 2030.\n\n\n\nAs Elizabeth Kolbert explained in The New Yorker a few days ago, this \u201cobscene\u201d power demand comes because when you ask AI to, say, help you with your bracket for the NCAA tournament, it has to sort through all human knowledge ever. As even AI apostle Sam Altman explained at Davos this year\n\n\u201cI think we still don\u2019t appreciate the energy needs of this technology.\u201d He didn\u2019t see how these needs could be met, he went on, \u201cwithout a breakthrough.\u201d He added, \u201cWe need fusion or we need, like, radically cheaper solar plus storage, or something, at massive scale\u2014like, a scale that no one is really planning for.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe truth is, there\u2019s no way we can build out renewable energy fast enough to meet this kind of extra demand\u2014it\u2019s going to be at the bleeding edge of the technically and politically possible to power the things we already do, live drive cars and heat homes. And so, in a rational world, faced with an emergency, we would put off scaling AI for now. The irony, of course, is that\u2019s it\u2019s often been touted as a tool to help solve climate change. But we have the tools we need\u2014plain old intelligence gave us cheap solar panels.\n\nWith the able technological assistance of my wife, I asked Anthropic\u2019s AI bot Claude to comment. It was amazing how much he sounded like a PR man; after spinning a lot of jargon-filled guff about how \u201cresponsible AI can likely be part of the solution to environmental challenges,\u201d he allowed as how he had no idea how much energy he was using. \u201cIn general, the electricity usage of large language models like myself is a relevant consideration from an environmental perspective, but quantifying the exact amount would require additional information I don\u2019t have access to.\u201d\n\nWhatever. What we need is not more intelligence. We need more wisdom, to guide us through this pinch point in the human experiment. Including the wisdom to say no to some things, at least until the emergency subsides.",

            "text": "Joe Biden Campaign Sets Sights On Flipping North Carolina In 2024\n\nPresident Biden\u2019s reelection campaign is considering North Carolina as a potential state to win in the 2024 election. In the previous election, former President Trump only managed to secure a narrow victory in this state.\n\nThe Biden campaign recognizes that it will require persistent effort to connect with every voter before November. The Tar Heel State presents a promising opportunity, particularly with a gubernatorial race that could provide a boost for Biden.\n\nHowever, strategists are skeptical about the feasibility of that goal. They point out that the state of [state] hasn\u2019t voted for a Democrat since 2008 and supported Trump in his last two presidential campaigns.\n\nAccording to GOP strategist Doug Heye, although it is still a goal to achieve, the state is undoubtedly up for grabs. Heye expressed confidence in Trump\u2019s chances of winning and even mentioned that if he were to place a bet, he would wager on Trump emerging victorious.\n\nNorth Carolina is a key component of the Biden campaign\u2019s plan to secure the necessary electoral votes to reach the 270 threshold. This strategy focuses on crucial swing states, including the blue wall states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, as well as western battlegrounds like Nevada and Arizona. Additionally, southern states such as Georgia and North Carolina are also part of this crucial pathway.\n\nCopy Copy\n\nNorth Carolina is part of a $30 million six-week advertising campaign that was announced after the State of the Union address. The campaign plans to spend a significant amount in battleground states. In an effort to connect with Black North Carolinians, a crucial voting group, Biden conducted radio interviews in Fayetteville and Charlotte around Super Tuesday. These interviews were aimed at reaching out to this important faction and securing another victory.\n\nOn March 26, Biden and Vice President Harris will be heading to North Carolina as part of their mission to visit every battleground state this month.\n\nAccording to Dory MacMillan, the North Carolina communications director for the Biden campaign, the people of North Carolina are aware that President Biden is fighting for their interests. In contrast, Donald Trump is seen as fighting for billionaires, corporations, and an extreme agenda that negatively impacts families and the economy. The Biden campaign is committed to reaching out to every corner of the state to reject Trump\u2019s attacks on families and work towards another four years of progress with President Biden.\n\nThe Biden campaign currently possesses a substantial $155 million fund, and while investment in infrastructure and campaign expenditure is crucial, strategists believe that the governor\u2019s race in North Carolina can significantly contribute to Biden\u2019s success. Notably, the inclusion of far-right Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson on the ballot is expected to play a significant role.\n\nAccording to Michael LaRosa, the traveling press secretary for first lady Jill Biden during the 2020 campaign, the Democratic candidate in North Carolina has a strong advantage this time around. LaRosa believes that the weak Republican gubernatorial candidate, combined with demographic shifts and a well-coordinated campaign, will provide the Biden team with a better opportunity to win the state.\n\nIn the previous election, Trump narrowly defeated Biden in North Carolina with a margin of less than 1 percentage point. The last time a Democrat emerged victorious in a presidential race in the state was when then-Democratic nominee Barack Obama won, but he subsequently lost his bid for re-election to 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney by a 2 percentage point margin. Trump secured North Carolina\u2019s electoral votes in 2016, when he first ran for the presidency, defeating Hillary Clinton by a comfortable margin of nearly 4 points.\n\nAccording to a collection of polls, Trump currently holds a 7.4 point lead over Biden in North Carolina. This lead is greater than what the former president has achieved in other key swing states.\n\nIn 2024, North Carolina might witness a split-ticket scenario. Although Trump emerged victorious in the state in 2020, Democratic Governor Roy Cooper was reelected for a second term. This suggests a potential outcome where Josh Stein, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee, secures a victory while Trump carries North Carolina.\n\nWith the lineup of Republican candidates, Democrats see North Carolina as a promising battleground worth investing their efforts in.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a wise decision,\u201d remarked Ivan Zapien, a former official at the Democratic National Committee. \u201cThe Republicans have chosen some down-ballot candidates who are unlikely to fare well in the suburbs, considering the recent performance of suburban areas in past election cycles. The timing is perfect for a potential gain.\u201d\n\nDemocrats admit that they face a challenging task ahead.\n\nAccording to LaRosa, North Carolina is in a prime position to flip in the upcoming election, but it is important to remember that it is still North Carolina.\n\nRepublicans, such as Heye, a North Carolina native, argue that the state is not a foregone conclusion, considering the changes in its demographics.\n\nAccording to the expert, there is a slim possibility that the Democrats could emerge victorious in the state due to its close margin and rapid expansion, particularly in the regions of Charlotte and Raleigh along with their surrounding suburbs.\n\nThe overturning of Roe v. Wade by the Supreme Court in 2022 led to unexpected results for Democrats, thanks to the increasing presence of young, professional suburban women in growing areas like Charlotte and Raleigh. These women played a significant role in supporting the party and its pro-choice stance.\n\nNorth Carolina is home to 11 historically Black colleges and universities, making it a crucial voting bloc for black voters.\n\nAccording to Jim Kessler, executive vice president for policy at Third Way, North Carolina can be compared to Georgia, a state that played a crucial role in securing Biden\u2019s victory in 2020. One of the key factors that contributed to Biden\u2019s success in Georgia was the support he received from Black voters.\n\nAccording to the expert, North Carolina and Georgia are both gaining a significant number of college-educated voters who are crucial for the Democratic Party. Although Georgia has a larger African American voter base, which played a key role in the 2020 election, North Carolina is emerging as a state where Democrats have a strong chance of prevailing.\n\nReference Article",

            "text": "Most of these Boosting Biden posts deal with ways that Joe Biden has helped all Americans. But Biden has also done a lot of targeted things that only local folks know about. Honestly, too often local folks don\u2019t even know! So we are going to celebrate some of those things here. Feel free to Kosmail me if you have ideas from your area.\n\nNow, of course, Illinois is an amazing state that didn\u2019t need \u201csaving.\u201d But as we are rolling with the superhero theme, please allow me some poetic license.\n\nWhat has he done for Illinois? A lot \u2014 from the very start. How about this:\n\nBetween January 2021 and June 2022, the Illinois economy added 309,900 jobs (5.4 percent of January 2021 employment in Illinois). The state economy recovered 83 percent of the jobs lost between February 2020 and April 2020. Residents of Illinois applied to start more new businesses during President Biden\u2019s first year in office than in any other year since the series started in 2005.\n\nAnd this, from August 2022:\n\nIllinois to Begin Work Plugging More Than 600 Orphaned Wells Through President Biden\u2019s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law\n\nThe Department of the Interior today announced that Illinois has been awarded an initial grant of $25 million from President Biden\u2019s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to begin work to plug, cap and reclaim orphaned oil and gas wells across the state. Millions of Americans across the country live within a mile of an orphaned oil and gas well. The state of Illinois has indicated that it will use this funding to plug between 600 to 800 documented wells. Funds will also be used to measure and track methane emissions and contamination in groundwater and surface water. Additionally, this funding will allow Illinois to expand its well-plugging capacity with the purchase of safety equipment, computers, vehicles, gas detectors, and a Forward Looking InfraRed camera, among other items. All of these will be used to plug documented wells and locate undocumented wells throughout the state that will be plugged with Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding in the upcoming years. Millions of Americans across the country live within a mile of an orphaned oil and gas well, which are polluting backyards, recreation areas and community spaces across the country. Methane leaking from many of these unplugged wells is a serious safety hazard and is a significant cause of climate change, being more than 25 times as potent as carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere. The historic investments to clean up these hazardous sites will create good-paying, union jobs, catalyze economic growth and revitalization, and reduce dangerous methane leaks.\n\nAnd this, from November 2023:\n\nBiden-Harris Administration Announces $336 Million Loan to Chicago to Help Remove 30,000 Lead Pipes Across the City\n\nToday, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Assistant Administrator for Water Radhika Fox announced a $336 million Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) loan to the City of Chicago. With help from this financing, the water department will replace up to 30,000 lead pipes that deliver water to homes across the city while creating an estimated 2,700 jobs. This action marks a significant step toward replacing all lead service lines\u2014a goal that is shared by the Biden Administration, the State of Illinois, and the City of Chicago. The Administration announced this WIFIA loan at a lead service line removal site in Chicago, Illinois, with U.S. Senator Dick Durbin, U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, and additional community leaders and stakeholders. \u201cWhether you are a resident of Chicago or any city across this nation, no person should worry if their water is safe to drink or if it will harm their children. With EPA\u2019s $336 million loan, the City of Chicago will replace up to 30,000 lead pipes so that more local residents can rest assured that their water is safe,\u201d said EPA Assistant Administrator for Water Radhika Fox. \u201cThe Biden-Harris Administration is committed to removing all lead pipes across this country,\u201d she continued, \u201cand EPA is using every tool available to address this public health issue. We are strengthening our regulations, investing in lead pipe replacement programs with $15 billion in dedicated funding under the President\u2019s Investing in America agenda, and we are prioritizing lead pipe removal under this program.\u201d The City of Chicago will use the WIFIA loan to help with replacing lead service lines serving single family homes and small multi-unit buildings citywide whenever there is a leak or break on a lead line or when performing water and sewer main updates. Although Chicago\u2019s water is in compliance with state and federal safety regulations, the City is committed to replacing all the legacy lead lines to help ensure that the water system is lead-free for generations to come.\n\nand this, from later in the same month:\n\nBiden says workers need \u2018a fair shot\u2019 as he celebrates the labor deal saving an Illinois auto plant\n\nPresident Joe Biden put on a red United Auto Workers shirt on Thursday as he celebrated a labor deal that will reopen the Stellantis plant in Belvidere, Illinois, treating the factory\u2019s salvation as a vindication of his decision to stand with striking union members as they demanded higher wages. \u201cAmerican workers are ready to work harder than anyone else,\u201d Biden told cheering autoworkers in a community center in the northern Illinois city. \u201cBut they just need to be given a shot. A fair shot and a fair wage.\u201d He praised the union members as \u201cas tough, tough, tough as they come.\u201d Someone in the audience shouted to the president, \u201cThat shirt looks good on you.\u201d\n\nand this, from just last month:\n\nBiden-Harris Administration Announces $76 Million to Revitalize Coal Communities, Create Good-Paying Jobs in Illinois\n\nAs part of the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s Investing in America tour, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals Management Dr. Steve Feldgus and Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement Principal Deputy Director Sharon Buccino traveled to Illinois today, where they announced $75.8 million in fiscal year 2023 funding from President Biden\u2019s Investing in America agenda to address dangerous and polluting abandoned mine lands and catalyze economic opportunity in Illinois. \u201cPresident Biden\u2019s Investing in America agenda gives us an unparalleled investment and opportunity to address the majority of currently known abandoned mine land hazards,\u201d said Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary Feldgus. \u201cThrough these new historic resources, the Interior Department is addressing long-standing environmental injustices, cleaning up toxic and hazardous sites and creating jobs and revitalizing former coal communities.\u201d [. . .] Millions of Americans nationwide live less than a mile from an abandoned coal mine. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law allocated a total of $16 billion to address legacy pollution, including $11.3 billion in abandoned mine land funding over 15 years, facilitated by the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement. This historic funding is expected to address the majority of currently inventoried abandoned coal mine lands in the nation.\n\nAnd finally this, just a couple of weeks ago:\n\nEPA announces cleanup will begin at the Asarco Taylor Springs Superfund site in Illinois as part of President Biden\u2019s Investing in America agenda\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency announced a third and final wave of more than $1 billion for cleanup projects at more than 100 Superfund sites across the country as part of President Biden\u2019s Investing in America agenda. This funding is made possible by the President\u2019s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and will launch new cleanup projects at 25 Superfund sites, including the Asarco Taylor Springs Superfund site in Taylor Springs, Ill. \u201cAlongside Illinois\u2019 rich industrial history lies the sobering reality of polluted sites that pose significant risks to public health and the environment,\u201d said Sen. Dick Durbin. \u201cThis federal funding is critical in our mission to restore contaminated sites for the benefit of every Illinois resident.\u201d \u201cEliminating contaminated sites is an important part of protecting the health of children and families,\u201d said Sen. Tammy Duckworth. \u201cAnd it is also a necessary part of helping spur development, job creation and economic growth for affected communities.\u201d \u201cRehabilitating polluted properties is critical in our efforts to revitalize underserved communities and drive economic growth,\u201d said Rep. Nikki Budzinski. \u201cIn Springfield, the Moving Pillsbury Forward project has shown us the promise that Superfund site resources have in transforming neighborhoods that have been left behind for too long.\u201d\n\nIs there still more work to be done? 100%! Lots more work. But Biden did more than many people guessed could be done. He deserves a lot of credit. AND he deserves to be re-elected.\n\nWhat can you do to help?\n\nYour donation will come bundled with others from our Good News community and will show Biden that there are many of us who support him and combine hard work with optimism in our battles for a better America!\n\nWant to do something else?\n\nRec and comment on these posts to keep them alive at DKos and share them with others who might not realize how great a president Joe Biden has been.\n\nLooking for something else?

            "text": "Will the Biden Impeachment Inquiry Bear Fruit Today?\n\nMarch 20, 2024 | Tags: LIBERTY DAILY\n\nDepending on who you ask, today is either the beginning of the end for the Biden Crime Family\u2019s influence peddling business or it\u2019s Kabuki Theater for Republicans to pretend they\u2019re finally getting tough with Hunter Biden, Uncle James, and Daddy Joe.\n\nWitnesses will be trotted out before the House Oversight Committee. These witnesses will support the contention by House Republicans that the Biden Crime Family got paid for doing nothing other than dishing out political favors from then-VP Joe Biden. It will be crystal clear to anyone who\u2019s paying attention that Joe was the product the family was selling. Hunter, James, and their cohorts offered nothing else of value in exchange for a whole lot of money from the highest bidders.\n\nUnfortunately, this will likely bear no real fruit other than score some political points in an election year. That\u2019s it. Neither Hunter nor James are going to jail. The man in the Oval Office will not be removed until either voters take him out in November or Barack Obama replaces him with another puppet before the election.\n\nConservative media will be aflutter. Corporate media will be bouncing back and forth between debunking and ignoring claims by witnesses and Committee members. Social media will trade clips of \u201cbombshells.\u201d But at the end of the day, nothing of substance will happen.\n\nSuch is the way in Washington DC. Depending on who\u2019s in power at the time, Democrats will either act to destroy the nation or Republicans will talk about taking action after the upcoming election. They always delay until the next election. That\u2019s the UniParty Swamp.\n\nHere\u2019s the writeup of Wednesday\u2019s happenings generated from corporate media reports\u2026.\n\nIn a \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d development, former business associates of Hunter Biden are set to testify publicly on Capitol Hill this Wednesday. This marks the beginning of the next phase in the impeachment inquiry against President Biden, as congressional Republicans take the lead.\n\nHouse Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer is expected to open the hearing by shedding light on a year-long investigation that has unearthed no credible evidence of the Bidens providing any work product. Furthermore, investigators have not identified any legitimate value or documents to support the Bidens\u2019 business partnerships.\n\nComer will emphasize that the Bidens\u2019 work methodology deviates from traditional norms. They do not function as consultants, lawyers, or advisors; nor do they sell products, services, or skill sets. Instead, the Bidens\u2019 primary asset is Joe Biden himself.\n\nComer will assert that Joe Biden has consistently taken actions to further his family\u2019s wealth accumulation. He will describe the alleged scam as a simple one: the Bidens promise to resolve foreign partners\u2019 issues by leveraging the U.S. government. This process has been repeated multiple times, with Joe Biden\u2019s power being invoked, subsequently resulting in millions of dollars flowing into the Bidens\u2019 pockets.\n\nTony Bobulinski, a U.S. Navy veteran, will testify publicly during a joint hearing of the House Oversight and Judiciary committees on Wednesday morning. Jason Galanis, serving a 14-year prison sentence for securities fraud, will also provide testimony, albeit virtually from a minimum-security prison in Alabama.\n\nDemocrats have invited Lev Parnas, a former associate of former Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani, to testify publicly as well.\n\nComer, in announcing the hearing earlier this month, extended an invitation to Hunter Biden to testify publicly, fulfilling the first son\u2019s repeated requests. However, through his attorney, Abbe Lowell, Hunter Biden rejected the invitation, dismissing the hearing as a \u201ccarnival side show.\u201d\n\nComer also invited Hunter Biden\u2019s former associate, Devon Archer, who is not expected to attend. Comer claims to have \u201ccalled Hunter Biden\u2019s bluff\u201d by offering a public hearing after the committee had deposed him, as per standard procedure for all witnesses.\n\nDuring Hunter Biden\u2019s deposition last month, he maintained that his father was never involved in or benefited from his business dealings. The committee also heard testimony from James Biden, the president\u2019s younger brother, who shared the same sentiment.\n\nHunter Biden did admit to putting his father on speakerphone with business associates and inviting him to business lunches. Archer had previously testified that Hunter Biden put his father on speakerphone at least 20 times with business associates.\n\nWithout Hunter and Archer, the hearing will feature Bobulinski, who worked with Hunter Biden to create SinoHawk Holdings, a joint venture with Chinese energy company CEFC. Bobulinski testified behind closed doors that he personally met with Joe Biden for more than 45 minutes in 2017.\n\nBobulinski also testified that Joe Biden \u201cenabled\u201d his son Hunter to sell access to the U.S.\u2019s \u201cmost dangerous adversaries,\u201d including the Chinese Communist Party, Russia, and others.\n\nGalanis\u2019 testimony will also focus on whether Joe Biden was involved in the businesses he worked on with Hunter Biden. Galanis, who was interviewed by congressional investigators last month, testified that Joe Biden was considering joining the board of a joint venture created by Hunter Biden and his business associates with ties to the Chinese Communist Party after he left the vice presidency.\n\nGalanis also mentioned that the phrase \u201clean in\u201d was used by Devon and Hunter Biden to signify access to Vice President Biden\u2019s political influence.\n\nDemocrats have criticized the impeachment investigation as \u201chopeless,\u201d with Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, stating that it originated from lies told by an indicted liar in close proximity to Russian agents.\n\nIt\u2019s always the Russians.\n\nThe post Will the Biden Impeachment Inquiry Bear Fruit Today? appeared first on \ud83d\udd14 The Liberty Daily.\n\n\n\nRead More...",

That\u2019s good news for the American people.\u201d\n\nCongress avoided a lengthy partial government shutdown Saturday when the Senate passed the spending package 74-24 in the wee hours of the morning. The bill passed the House on Friday by a vote of 286-134, with a majority of Republicans, 113, voting against it.\n\nUS NATIONAL DEBT TRACKER FOR MARCH 22, 2024: SEE WHAT AMERICAN TAXPAYERS (YOU) OWE IN REAL TIME\n\nRepublican opponents seethed as the package moved through Congress, arguing that it did little to address the $34 trillion national debt, funded Biden\u2019s policies that they oppose and failed to include border security enforcement measures that GOP lawmakers had demanded in order to fund the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nThe final vote violated the so-called Hastert Rule, a long held GOP \u201crule,\u201d named after former House Speaker Dennis Hastert, that holds Republican leadership should allow votes only on bills that have a \u201cmajority of the majority\u201d in agreement \u2014 in other words, only if a majority of Republicans support them.\n\nThat outcome reflected deep divisions within the House GOP conference, with many Republicans expressing frustration at leadership for unveiling the 1,012-page package just 48 hours before lawmakers were asked to vote.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s total lack of backbone, total lack of leadership, and a total failure by Republican leadership. There\u2019s no other way to describe it,\u201d Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, said Thursday on former Trump White House adviser Stephen K. Bannon\u2019s \u201cWar Room.\u201d \u201cThis bill is an abomination.\u201d\n\nSENATE PASSES MAMMOTH $1.2T SPENDING PACKAGE AFTER BRIEF PARTIAL GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN\n\nSenate Republicans who opposed the package made similar complaints, with Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah., telling Fox News Digital that it was an \u201cutterly absurd, insulting and lawless suggestion that that is an appropriate legislative process.\u201d\n\nSen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., accused the bill\u2019s supporters of \u201ccaving to Biden & Schumer & voting for billions in earmarks and special interest giveaways,\u201d in a post on X.\n\nGOP firebrand Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., went so far as to introduce a motion to remove House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., from leadership, accusing him of betrayal. Other Republicans, like Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., said that removing Johnson would be a \u201cmistake,\u201d arguing that the speaker has done \u201cthe best he could\u201d with a one-seat majority.\n\nWhile Washington Republicans fight each other, Trump has not yet offered a clear vision for how he would manage these spending crises, were he to win back the White House in 2024.\n\nHOUSE PASSES $1.2 TRILLION GOVERNMENT SPENDING BILL TO AVERT GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN\n\nOn the campaign trail, the presumptive GOP nominee has insisted that he will pay off the national debt if he ousts Biden. But while Trump was president from 2017 through 2020, the laws and executive orders he signed added an estimated $8.4 trillion to the national debt, with interest, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB).\n\nIndeed, Trump was responsible for signing several trillion-dollar omnibus spending bills into law, even before the COVID-19 pandemic. Excluding COVID relief, Trump added $4.8 trillion to the debt over his four years in office, CRFB estimates.\n\nIn his first two years in office, when the House and Senate were in Republican hands, the Trump White House unsuccessfully sought to cut about $15 billion in federal spending with a recissions request. That effort narrowly passed the House and died in the Senate, where Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Richard Burr, R-N.C. sided with Democrats on a procedural vote to kill it.\n\nIn 2018, faced with a $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill, Trump backed down from a veto threat and reluctantly signed the bill, reasoning that it provided needed funds for the military.\n\nBIDEN SAYS $1.2T SPENDING PACKAGE IS \u2018GOOD NEWS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE,\u2019 BUT CONGRESS\u2019 WORK ISN\u2019T OVER\n\n\u201cI say to Congress, I will never sign another bill like this again,\u201d Trump said in remarks after he signed the bill.\n\nThe very next year, Trump signed a $1.4 trillion spending package to avert a partial government shutdown. He did so again as one of his last acts as president in December 2020, putting his signature on another massive $1.4 trillion omnibus that included $900 billion in COVID-19 aid.\n\nBut while Trump did not keep his promise to get federal spending under control in his first term, Biden is on track to exceed Trump\u2019s debt accumulation by the end of this year. In his first three years as president, Biden has added $6.75 trillion to the national debt, according to Treasury Department data. In his final year, the Congressional Budget Office projects a deficit of $1.58 trillion \u2014 which would total $8.3 trillion by the end of Biden\u2019s first term.\n\nThose estimates were made before Biden signed the new $1.2 trillion appropriations package on Saturday.\n\nBiden\u2019s fiscal year 2025 budget calls for $3.3 trillion in net deficit reduction, although the revenue that is needed to achieve that goal would mostly come from tax increases. Biden has promised not to increase taxes on those making less than $400,000, but he otherwise has called for a repeal of Trump\u2019s tax cuts and additional taxes on corporations and the wealthy.\n\nTrump has campaigned on new rounds of tax cuts, arguing that economic growth stimulated by lower taxes will make up for any loss in government revenue. But he has yet to tell voters how he plans to cut spending, or how he will work with Congress to break the cycle of last-minute omnibus spending bills that were characteristic of his first term.",

            "text": "Reading Time: 3 minutes\n\nBiden signs $1.2 trillion funding bill, averting government shutdown\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn November 15, 2021, President Joe Biden signed a $1.2 trillion funding bill into law, averting a government shutdown that was looming just days away. The bill, which funds the government through September 2022, includes provisions for defense, domestic programs, and infrastructure projects. The signing of the bill comes after weeks of negotiations in Congress to reach a compromise on the budget and avoid a potential shutdown.\n\nThe funding bill, officially known as the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2022, provides funding for a wide range of government agencies and programs. It includes funding for the military, education, healthcare, transportation, and other essential services. The bill also includes funding for infrastructure projects, including roads, bridges, and public transportation systems.\n\nOne of the key provisions of the funding bill is the allocation of $782 billion for defense spending. This includes funding for military personnel, equipment, and operations. The bill also includes funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs, ensuring that veterans receive the care and support they need.\n\nIn addition to defense spending, the funding bill includes funding for domestic programs such as education, healthcare, and housing. This includes funding for programs such as Head Start, Medicaid, and affordable housing initiatives. The bill also includes funding for disaster relief efforts, providing assistance to communities affected by natural disasters such as hurricanes, wildfires, and floods.\n\nAnother important aspect of the funding bill is the allocation of funding for infrastructure projects. The bill includes $110 billion for infrastructure investments, including funding for roads, bridges, and public transportation systems. This funding will help to modernize the country\u2019s infrastructure and create jobs in the construction industry.\n\nThe signing of the funding bill by President Biden comes after weeks of negotiations in Congress to reach a compromise on the budget. Democrats and Republicans worked together to craft a bipartisan bill that met the needs of the American people and avoided a government shutdown. The bill passed both the House and Senate with strong bipartisan support, demonstrating the ability of Congress to work together in a productive and efficient manner.\n\nThe signing of the funding bill was welcomed by lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer praised the bill as a \u201cwin for the American people\u201d and a demonstration of what Congress can accomplish when they work together. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi also hailed the bill as a \u201cvictory for the American people\u201d and a testament to the power of bipartisanship.\n\nThe funding bill also includes provisions to address the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. It includes funding for vaccine distribution, testing, and treatment efforts. The bill also includes funding for public health programs to help prevent the spread of the virus and protect vulnerable populations.\n\nOverall, the signing of the $1.2 trillion funding bill by President Biden represents a significant achievement for the government and the American people. The bill provides funding for essential government services, infrastructure projects, and COVID-19 relief efforts. It demonstrates the ability of Congress to come together and pass legislation that meets the needs of the country.\n\nLooking ahead, the focus will now turn to implementing the provisions of the funding bill and ensuring that the allocated funds are used effectively and efficiently. President Biden and lawmakers will work to ensure that the funding is directed towards programs and projects that benefit the American people and help to strengthen the country\u2019s economy and infrastructure.\n\nIn conclusion, the signing of the $1.2 trillion funding bill by President Biden represents a major milestone in the government\u2019s efforts to fund essential services and avoid a government shutdown. The bill provides funding for defense, domestic programs, infrastructure projects, and COVID-19 relief efforts. It demonstrates the power of bipartisanship and the ability of Congress to work together to pass legislation that benefits the American people. The focus will now turn to implementing the provisions of the funding bill and ensuring that the allocated funds are used effectively and efficiently to benefit the country as a whole.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource link\n\n\n\nGovernment,The Biden administration\n\n\n\n#Biden #signs #trillion #funding #bill #averting #government #shutdown",

            "text": "While the anger was a bit misplaced, one can easily understand why liberals were furious that the now-deceased Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg didn\u2019t step down before the 2014 midterm elections.\n\nAfter all, the writing was on the wall. In the sixth year of Barack Obama in the White House, Americans had gotten fed up with the Democrats and the Senate was poised to change hands. If Republicans were to take control of the Senate, they would stall any nominee the then-president chose to fill a vacancy on the court.\n\nGinsburg was 81 at the time and had battled cancer. She was the liberal-appointed justice most likely to fall to tragedy, speaking in purely actuarial terms. In fact, she had made it to the age of 87 when she died in 2020.\n\nThat was when then-President Donald Trump nominated Amy Coney Barrett to replace her and she was confirmed by a GOP-controlled Senate.\n\nThe same can\u2019t be said for Merrick Garland, of course. In 2016, he was the man Obama was nominated to the court after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February of that year.\n\nGiven that the Republicans controlled the Senate, they were in no mood to confirm one of the administration\u2019s justices, particularly in an election year, and then-Majority Leader Mitch McConnell declined to even give Garland a hearing. (Garland\u2019s nakedly partisan contempt for the rule of law as attorney general of the United States under President Joe Biden has revealed this course of action to have been a wise one.)\n\nHowever, the Democrats still have control of the White House and Senate. Whether that lasts is anyone\u2019s guess; Trump leads Biden in the polls and outlook for the upper chamber isn\u2019t superb for the Democrats even if they\u2019re able to keep control of 1600 Pennsylvania.\n\nThat\u2019s why generally lib-friendly writer Josh Barro \u2014 a politics and economics journo who tends to be very Biden-supportive on his Substack, even if he mostly remains nominally neutral \u2014 thinks it\u2019s high time the Dems pressured Sonia Sotomayor to retire.\n\nWait, you might be saying \u2014 isn\u2019t Sotomayor young, by the standards of the gerontocracy in Washington? At age 69, yes she is, even if she is (as Barro noted) \u201ca diabetic who has in some instances traveled with a medic.\u201d However, in a Substack post excerpted by lefty rag The Atlantic on Monday, Barro called out liberal \u201ccowardice in speaking up about Sotomayor\u201d and her age.\n\nIn 2006, Barro wrote, Scalia was 70 years old with 20 years of service on the court behind him. If he had retired then, then-President George W. Bush could nominate his replacement for confirmation by a Republican-controlled Senate. That would have kept Scalia\u2019s seat on the court safely in conservative hands, potentially for decades.\n\nBarro asked readers to \u201cimagine for a moment that Hillary Clinton had won the 2016 election, as many expected.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy running a few points stronger, she might have taken Democratic candidates across the finish line in close races in Pennsylvania and Missouri, resulting in Democratic control of the Senate,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cIn that scenario, Clinton would have named a liberal successor to Scalia \u2014 more liberal than Garland \u2014 and conservatives would have lost control of the Court, all because of Scalia\u2019s failure to retire at the opportune moment.\u201d\n\nThis, mind you, is a scenario liberals believe they deserve anyway \u2014 and have been willing to back court-packing and similar schemes in order to achieve it. It didn\u2019t happen, and any scenario that involves keeping Missouri blue given the red drift in that state is a bit ludicrous. Nevertheless, Barro noted that Sotomayor is the oldest of the three liberal-appointed justices.\n\n\u201cJustice Sonia Sotomayor will turn 70 in June. If she retires this year, President Joe Biden will nominate a young and reliably liberal judge to replace her,\u201d Barro wrote.\n\n\u201cRepublicans do not control the Senate floor and cannot force the seat to be held open like they did when Scalia died. Confirmation of the new justice will be a slam dunk, and liberals will have successfully shored up one of their seats on the Court \u2014 playing the kind of defense that is smart and prudent when your only hope of controlling the Court again relies on both the timing of the death or retirement of conservative judges and not losing your grip on the three seats you already hold.\u201d\n\nAnd, if she doesn\u2019t retire this year, Barro wrote, \u201cwe don\u2019t know when she will next be able to retire with a likely liberal replacement.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible that Democrats will retain the presidency and the Senate in this year\u2019s elections, in which case the insurance created by a Sotomayor retirement won\u2019t have been necessary,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut if Democrats lose the presidency or the Senate this fall\u2014or both\u2014she\u2019ll need to stay on the bench until the party once again controls them. That could be just a few years, or it could be longer.\n\n\u201cDemocrats have previously had to wait as long as 14 years (1995 to 2009). In other words, if Sotomayor doesn\u2019t retire this year, she\u2019ll be making a bet that she will remain fit to serve until possibly age 78 or even 82 or 84 \u2014 and she\u2019ll be forcing the whole Democratic Party to make that high-stakes bet with her.\u201d\n\nYet, Democrats have reportedly been on the fence about replacing her with a younger justice because she\u2019s the first Latina woman on the court.\n\n\u201cThis is incredibly gutless,\u201d Barro wrote. \u201cYou\u2019re worried about putting control of the Court completely out of reach for more than a generation, but because she is Latina, you can\u2019t hurry along an official who\u2019s putting your entire policy project at risk? If this is how the Democratic Party operates, it deserves to lose.\u201d [Emphasis his.]\n\nHe called this \u201cpart of a broader insanity in the way that the Democratic Party thinks about diversity and representation\u201d \u2014 which isn\u2019t necessarily a lie, but that\u2019s part of a much broader problem in American liberalism than he lets on.\n\n\u201cRepresentation is supposed to be important because the presence of different sorts of people in positions of power helps ensure that the interests and preferences of various communities are taken into account when making policy. But in practice, Democratic Party actions regarding diversity tend to be taken for the benefit of officials rather than demographic groups,\u201d Barro wrote. (Emphasis his. And by the way, duh.)\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s more important for ordinary Latina women who support Democrats \u2014 that there not be one more vote against abortion rights on the Supreme Court, or that Sotomayor is personally there to write dissenting opinions? The answer is obvious, unless you work in Democratic politics for a living, in which case it apparently becomes a difficult call.\u201d\n\nThis should be a difficult call for a number of different reasons, albeit not the identitarian ones Barro says the Democrats are falling prey to. The biggest one is this: While justices on the Supreme Court have, in the past, skewed one way or another in terms of ideology depending on who nominated them, it\u2019s still supposed to be the one non-political branch of the federal government.\n\nWhile the politicization of the Supreme Court has taken many faces, both Democrat and Republican,a milestone was reached during the Obama years, when the then-president set a precedent by lecturing the Supreme Court on campaign finance law during the 2010 State of the Union. President Biden continued that tradition 14 years later, though only six of nine justices were there to hear it.\n\nSonia Sotomayor is mostly healthy and, by the standards of Washington, D.C., young. But, if having someone in her late 60s on the bench is too problematic for the Democrats, why stop there?\n\nElena Kagan, Obama\u2019s other appointee, is 63. Replace them both with fresh Harvard Law grads, I say, preferably those who skipped a few years back in high school. Make sure they haven\u2019t taken a gap year, of course, and have passed rigorous physicals. Check their family history for longevity, as well. Make sure that they\u2019ve got great-grandparents in their 90s still alive and kicking. Not that it matters, because they\u2019ll probably be asked to retire before the odometer hits the big 7-0, but you can never be too careful.\n\nI\u2019m not saying that Sotomayor is some kind of genius jurist who cannot be replaced, but Barro\u2019s reductio ad absurdum thought experiment demonstrates the issue with this.\n\nIt\u2019s bad enough that leftists are infuriated with the current Supreme Court majority simply because it follows the Constitution as written and not as a rubber stamp for social policy that fails at the legislative level. (Cough cough Roe v. Wade cough.)\n\nThey now want to disabuse whatever trust conservatives and independents might have in the court by just sewing up seats via trading out justices for other younger nominees.\n\nMoreover, if the nine men and women on the Supreme Court bench can easily be replaced by less-experienced lawyers simply for perceived actuarial benefits, it\u2019s essentially starting a political arms race to the bottom when it comes to judicial experience on the highest court in the land. Oh, you found a 45-year-old to replace Sonia Sotomayor? Well, here\u2019s a 35-year-old to replace Clarence Thomas! And a 29-year-old to take over for Alito! These would be people selected for their potential longevity, not on merit. If you want a surefire way to ruin the court, this is it.\n\nAnd, yes, Barro realizes the irony here: \u201cOne obvious response to this argument is that the president is also old \u2014 much older, indeed, than Sonia Sotomayor,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI am aware, and I consider this to be a serious problem. But Democrats are unlikely to find a way to replace Biden with a younger candidate who enhances their odds of winning the election.\u201d\n\nNor are they likely to find a way to replace Sotomayor that doesn\u2019t boil down to electoral cynicism. Sotomayor is a decade younger than Biden, still in relative good health and \u2014 this is the important thing \u2014 in compos mentis. If there\u2019s any way to seal the deal for Republicans who are Trump-averse to vote the GOP ticket this November, pressuring her not to pull an RBG (who was a decade olderand cancer survivor when there were calls for her to step aside in 2014) is pretty much it.\n\nThen again, maybe Barro is saying the quiet part out loud: The establishment media thinks Trump and the GOP may not even need something like that to win.\n\nAfter all, he\u2019s not the only one talking about Sotomayor\u2019s seat, as an article last week in Bloomberg Law pointed out.\n\nWhen The Atlantic is sounding the alarm so blatantly, there\u2019s a reason. The left is panicking and desperate to shove a minority woman off the court in order to shore up whatever support it has there. That ought to tell you a lot about how the establishment media thinks this race is going to play out. Trump may win and everyone has to make sacrifices \u2014 including Sonya Sotomayor.\n\nIf that sacrifice is Sotomayor giving up a Supreme Court seat, well, so be it.\n\nThis article appeared originally on The Western Journal.",

Backlogs in some immigrant-visa categories are 50 or even 100 times higher than they were four years ago, at the start of the Trump administration.\n\nSome of the backlogs are due to restrictions imposed in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. But some also spring from pre-pandemic Trump policies or actions that the Biden administration hasn\u2019t unwound.\n\nThe Biden administration is still reviewing or hasn\u2019t fully reversed some measures that slow or block processing, such as heightened background checks and questionable terrorism designations.\n\nIn a policy reversal just Thursday, the State Department said that in places that are subject to regional pandemic travel restrictions, it will now let people seeking immigrant and fiancee visas go ahead and apply. Secretary of State Antony Blinken determined that \u201cit is in the national interest\u201d to exempt those applicants from the restrictions, a spokesman said.\n\nThen, too, the effects of a Trump-era freeze on State Department hiring have left its consular sections short-staffed.\n\nMeanwhile, Biden has come under fire from Democrats for not, as of Friday, raising the refugee cap for this fiscal year to 62,500, as his administration proposed back in February. Biden also proposed a target cap of 125,000 for the fiscal year starting in October, up from Trump\u2019s 2020 cap of 15,000, the lowest level ever.\n\nAt a briefing on Thursday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins that Biden remains committed to raising the cap to 62,500 by the end of the fiscal year, September 30, but she did not say when he\u2019ll do so.\n\nExpect impact into next year\n\nBiden has revoked immigration restrictions ranging from a travel ban targeting mostly Muslim-majority countries to, on April 1, reversing a policy under which certain asylum or immigration applications were rejected if the applicant had left any blank spaces on their forms.\n\nBut immigrants and asylum seekers are discovering that the effects of the obstacles the Trump administration erected are likely to continue choking the flow into the US of legal immigrants and asylum seekers well into next year.\n\nLeon Rodriguez, who served as director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services from 2014 to 2017, said he thinks it will take the Biden administration \u201ca long time\u201d to return to or surpass pre-Trump levels of immigration and refugee admissions.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ve ever had \u2026 as focused an effort on all fronts by the executive branch to reduce levels of immigration as you did from the Trump administration,\u201d he said.\n\nSarah Bahiraei, a US citizen, married Afshin Bahiraei, from Iran, in 2017. They have been living in Turkey with their daughter, Esther, while trying to get a spousal visa for Afshin to emigrate to the US. Courtesy Sarah Bahiraei\n\nMelanie Nezer, a senior vice president at HIAS, a nonprofit that provides humanitarian aid and assistance to refugees, put it this way: \u201cPicture a door like in New York City in the \u201970s, with a hundred locks. The Trump administration locked all those locks. The Biden administration has to find all those keys, unlock those locks, and they can\u2019t open the door until all that is done.\u201d\n\nThe State Department, in an email to CNN, said that \u201cbacklog numbers will continue to fluctuate\u201d depending on pandemic conditions at various embassies and consulates, and on the rate at which Homeland Security and US Citizenship and Immigration Services \u201capprove additional petitions.\u201d\n\nPandemic effect\n\nTo understand the challenges, consider the visa process. In March 2020, citing the Covid-19 pandemic, the State Department suspended routine visa services at embassies and consulates around the world. The next month, then-President Trump issued and twice extended a proclamation suspending the entry of most immigrants who didn\u2019t already have valid visas until March 31, 2021. The State Department interpreted the bar on entry as also stopping it from issuing most immigrant visas, according to lawsuits against the agency. Although, by July, then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo began letting consulates and embassies reopen for limited visa operations at the discretion of their local chiefs of mission, most stayed closed for all but emergency services, State Department legal filings show.\n\nFor security reasons, \u201cyou can\u2019t adjudicate visas or passports from home,\u201d said Michele Thoren Bond, a former State Department assistant secretary for consular affairs. \u201cAnything passport, anything visa-related, you have to be in the office to do it; and to initiate visa cases you have to bring the applicants into the embassy for interviews, too. Even if you reopen, you can\u2019t let them come in the numbers that would have been normal, pre-Covid.\u201d\n\nIn legal filings, the State Department said that because of illnesses and other issues, after Pompeo gave posts the option to reopen, that next month, August, more than two thirds of the 143 US consular posts didn\u2019t schedule a single immigrant visa interview. Even by January, a third of consulates and embassies still were unable to schedule a single interview.\n\nA look at family-preference visas, which are issued to people seeking to join a relative already in the US, show how hard the pandemic restrictions hit a system already slowed by other Trump-administration moves.\n\nIn February 2017, just after Trump took office, there was a backlog of 2,312 family-preference visa applications, according to Rebecca Austin, assistant director of the National Visa Center at the State Department. Each of the next three years, that backlog more than doubled and doubled again, reaching 26,737 by Feb. 8, 2020. Then, due to the pandemic closures, by February 8 of this year, the backlog leaped to nearly 285,000, she said in a declaration to a federal court in California.\n\nVisa interviews plummet\n\nDocuments filed in a visa lawsuit show that during the month of January 2020, before the pandemic, the State Department scheduled 22,856 family-preference visa interviews, worldwide. This past January, it scheduled 262 \u2013 a drop of nearly 99%.\n\nImmigration attorneys in several visa lawsuits said the State Department continued to use temporary pandemic bans on entry from certain regions as a reason not to issue visas \u2013 even though a federal judge told the State Department last September that plaintiffs seeking to overturn that policy \u201care likely to succeed\u201d in their claim that it isn\u2019t in accordance with law. The department reversed that policy for immigrant and fianc\u00e9e visa applicants on Thursday.\n\nIn a written response to queries from CNN, the State Department said that \u201cembassies and consulates are working to resume routine visa services on a location-by-location basis as expeditiously as possible in a safe manner,\u201d but that \u201cWe do not expect to be able to safely return to pre-pandemic workload levels until mid-2021 at the earliest.\u201d Officials said health and safety measures would force them to \u201cprioritize the most urgent and mission-critical cases\u201d while scheduling fewer interviews than was normal before the pandemic.\n\nEfforts to get back to pre-pandemic visa levels face another obstacle: Last fall, Pompeo expanded a pandemic hiring freeze on consular officers, saying that with fewer people traveling to the US, the State Department wouldn\u2019t need them. State Department officials declined CNN requests to discuss the extent of the consular shortfall; but in January, Blinken told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the department had about 1,000 fewer employees than it had at the start of the Trump administration.\n\nBecause the Bureau of Consular Affairs relies mostly on visa and passport fees to fund its operations, the State Department said that the sharp drop in fee revenue from the pandemic \u201cwill have continuing effects on our staffing and available resources for several years, which means even when post-specific conditions improve, many posts will not be able to immediately return to pre-pandemic workload levels.\u201d\n\nHouse and Senate Democrats have proposed a budget that would let the State Department hire about 1,200 new Foreign Service officers, including consular officers. But even if that budget is adopted, hiring and training new consular officers can take a year and a half or longer, especially for those learning challenging languages.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very, very big hole,\u201d said Bond, the former assistant secretary for consular affairs. \u201cIt is super challenging. You are not issuing library cards here, you have to examine every application, in many cases you have to interview the applicant \u2026 there are checks that are being performed back in Washington; the whole interagency process, it is something that takes time.\u201d\n\nLottery winners\u2019 worries\n\nState Department visa delays particularly worried those waiting to get or use diversity visas \u2013 up to 55,000 immigration visas a year that are awarded by lottery to qualified people from countries with low levels of immigration to the US.\n\nWinning a diversity visa is always a long shot; in fiscal 2018, for example, nearly 14.7 million people applied for the lottery, giving each one odds of 1 in 267 of being selected and then getting a visa.\n\nBy law, diversity visas expire if they aren\u2019t processed and issued in the same fiscal year. But as the pandemic closed US consular sections, the diversity-visa clock kept ticking\n\nAja Tamamu Mariama Kinteh, 33, a statistician from Banjul, capital of The Gambia, was thrilled when she won the visa lottery on her second try, in May 2019. (The diversity visa included her husband, a software designer, and their three children). She was offered a visa interview at the US embassy in neighboring Dakar, Senegal, on April 21, 2020, according to legal filings in a lawsuit against the State Department.\n\nBut then the pandemic closure pushed her interview to August. And then the Trump administration extended the immigration ban through the end of 2020 \u2013 far past the September 30 deadline for her to get her visa.\n\n\u201cI was devastated,\u201d she said in a court declaration. \u201cMy whole family became heartbroken.\u201d They\u2019d sold their car and other property to pay for their fees and travel costs. Kinteh eventually joined a visa lawsuit in the US and got a court-ordered interview in September. But it wasn\u2019t until February 19, when the federal district court in Washington D.C. issued an emergency injunction preserving and extending the validity of most fiscal year 2020 diversity visas, that Kinteh could be sure she and her family could actually come to the US. They arrived in March, and are now in the state of Washington, her attorney said.\n\nOn February 24, Biden revoked parts of the three presidential proclamations that had blocked entry of most immigrants. The next day, the State Department announced it would start processing immigrant visa applications again, and that it would reconsider cases of those who qualified for visas but had been denied because of the Trump-era proclamations.\n\nIran\u2019s compulsory military service\n\nBut thousands of immigrant visa applicants from one country face yet another holdover obstacle.\n\nAn April 2019 Trump presidential proclamation declared the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps to be a terrorist organization. That proclamation \u2013 which the Biden administration has not, so far, revisited \u2013 bars anyone who\u2019s served in the revolutionary guards from being granted a US visa.\n\nIran makes military service compulsory for men; conscientious objection isn\u2019t allowed. Men who don\u2019t serve aren\u2019t allowed to marry, to get passports, or to hold most jobs. Men have no choice in what military branch they\u2019re assigned to \u2013 including the revolutionary guards, said Paris Etemadi Scott, legal director of the Pars Equality Center, an immigration services non-profit based in San Jose, California.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re on board with banning terrorists and keeping IRGC on the terrorist organization list, but not with keeping a husband from joining his spouse because 40 years ago he did mandatory service with IRGC, and by way they don\u2019t get to choose,\u201d she said.\n\nEhsan Orojlou, 36, and a civil engineer in Tehran who is currently waiting for his diversity visa, is one of those hoping the Biden administration will clarify the terrorist organization designation of the IRGC so that it won\u2019t prevent issuing visas to those, like him, who served in the guards only because they had no choice.\n\nOrojlou said in a phone interview that he spent his obligatory military service typing letters and filing paperwork for the IRGC in Karaj, a suburb of Tehran, 14 years ago; and he said there are plenty of others like him. \u201cMost of us are engineers, doctors,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have not killed a cockroach; how on earth can we be terrorists, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nSarah Vosseteig Bahiraei, a US citizen, was teaching in Turkey\u2019s Cappadocia region when she fell in love with Afshin Bahiraei, a Christian refugee from Iran. They married in 2015; and, as CNN reported two years ago, their application for a spousal visa got caught up in Trump\u2019s travel ban. Now, they have a daughter, Esther, born in Turkey \u2013 and they\u2019re still waiting, because Afshin Bahiraei, too, did his obligatory military service with the IRGC. He suspects that\u2019s why his visa application remains in the limbo of administrative processing.\n\nThe State Department declined to say whether it is re-examining who should fall under the bar on visas for members of the IRGC.\n\nSome face other obstacles. Because the US and Iran don\u2019t have diplomatic relations, Iranians have to travel to a neighboring country to apply for a US visa. Negar Bayati, a legal permanent resident who moved to the US in 2016 on a diversity visa, said that her husband Pooria\u2019s March 2020 spousal-visa interview, scheduled at the US embassy in Abu Dhabi, was canceled by the pandemic closure. Now the US embassy has started issuing visa appointments again \u2013 but Abu Dhabi and the other emirates have their own pandemic travel bans from Iran and many other countries; and the US embassy there has turned down Bayati\u2019s and her husband\u2019s request to have the case moved to another US embassy in that region, she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a crazy situation,\u201d Bayati said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a horrible year for me. I thought my husband was going to be here last March.\u201d",

According to Trump, many of the migrants entering the United States are \u201cbad people\u201d and \u201cmentally ill.\u201d\n\nDuring the interview, Trump emphasized the impact on American families, highlighting the tragic story of Laken Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student who was murdered by a migrant. Trump has made efforts to support \u201cAngel Families,\u201d those who have lost loved ones due to crimes committed by migrants.

He went as far as suggesting that Venezuela is sending criminals to the border, causing a surge in crime. According to Trump, the situation is so severe that even the police are having physical altercations with migrants, something he claims he has never witnessed before.\n\nAdditionally, Trump expressed his concern regarding the strain on big cities like New York City due to the influx of migrants. He questioned the sudden availability of billions of dollars to address the problem and warned that these migrants are \u201ctough people\u201d who pose a threat to American cities.\n\nIn Trump\u2019s view, Biden\u2019s immigration policies have led to a surge in migrant crime, with potentially dangerous individuals entering the country unlawfully. Trump\u2019s stance aligns with his long-held views on border security and immigration control, advocating for stricter measures to protect American citizens.",

            "text": "On April 7, 1992, then-Senator Joe Biden criticized those who interfered in Israel\u2019s affairs.\n\nHe declared: \u201cThe absurd notion that publicly vilifying Israel will somehow change its policy; who in the hell do we think we\u2019re dealing with? What makes us think, even if the administration is 100% correct on the policy, what makes them think that in the midst of an election campaign, in the midst of a so-called peace talk, that we can publicly vilify a nation, persons, and think that a leader is going to say, now I will yield before the world and God, because I\u2019ve been told? What in the hell do we think we\u2019re doing?\u201d\n\nBiden noted, \u201cWhy, why is there any incentive for the Arabs to make any compromise, any compromise, in the peace talks? Why, if they know that they must only wait for the United States to do their bargaining for them? Why would they compromise? Why would they be reasonable?\u201d\n\nInterestingly, James Baker was serving as secretary of state at the time. Baker is infamous for his comment \u201cF\u2014 the Jews, they don\u2019t vote for us anyway.\u201d Baker\u2019s comments proved a self-fulfilling prophecy. His boss, President George H.W. Bush, went from 35% of the Jewish vote in 1988 to 12% in the 1992 election, which he lost to Bill Clinton.\n\nBaker wasn\u2019t the first to make such a miscalculation. President Jimmy Carter\u2019s Chief of Staff Hamilton Jordan warned Carter that his policies towards Israel would alienate American Jews. Carter ignored him and went from 71% of the Jewish vote in 1976 to 45% in the 1980 election he lost to Ronald Reagan.\n\nToday, President Joe Biden, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and even Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer appear to have adopted the same failed strategy, except to them, the watchword is, in effect: F\u2014 the Jews, they\u2019ll vote for us anyway. But just as Baker and Carter were wrong to discount the Jewish vote, those who do so now to justify policies hostile to Israel do so at their own peril.\n\nBy strange coincidence, New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman is again playing a major role in all this. Back in the early \u201890s, Friedman played tennis with Baker and served as the press mouthpiece for Baker\u2019s policy of blaming Israel for the lack of Middle East peace. At the time, Baker and Bush were pressuring then-Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to forgo his insistence on bilateral negotiations. They did so by threatening to withhold U.S. loan guarantees intended to assist Israel in absorbing a million olim from the Soviet Union.\n\nToday, Friedman is once again a mouthpiece, this time for the Biden administration\u2019s policy of attacking Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over Israel\u2019s defensive war against Hamas. Rather than insist on Hamas surrendering and releasing all the hostages\u2014including the American ones\u2014which would end the war immediately, the administration is more interested in pandering to a few thousand Muslim voters in swing states who hate Israel and often support Hamas. This is an offensive and self-destructive policy.\n\nThere are already strong signs that, as a result of his misguided approach, Biden is hemorrhaging Jewish support. A Sienna poll of New York voters found former President Donald Trump winning the Jewish vote by a wide margin. This is in keeping with the results of the 2020 election, which saw Trump\u2019s share of Florida\u2019s Jewish voters rise from 23% in 2016 to 41%.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of American Jews and Americans in general support Israel and disdain Hamas. The exponential rise in antisemitic incidents and failure of Biden\u2019s vaunted plan to combat antisemitism, as well as his failure even to mention the problem in his State of the Union address are also leading many Jews to drop their support for Biden.\n\nIn 1992, Friedman and Baker inadvertently undermined Jewish support for the Republican Party. Friedman and Biden are now doing the same to the Democrats. History demonstrates that sitting presidents who turn on Israel always end up in failure and defeat.",

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) pressured Republicans to name the specific crime they are accusing President Biden of as they proceed with their impeachment inquiry.\n\nOcasio-Cortez noted the recent arrest of a former FBI informant for lying to the agency, fabricating the claim that Biden accepted a bribe while vice president to take actions to benefit the Ukrainian energy company his son served on the board of.\n\n\u201cAt this point, the story isn\u2019t the fact that the basis of this impeachment inquiry is wrong. The story is, \u2018Why it is proceeding anyway?\u2019\u201d she asked, saying Republicans have \u201cno charges.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have yet to hear in the chairman\u2019s opening the allegation that they are specifically charging the president of the United States with. I am hearing about the \u2018Biden family.\u2019 I am hearing about this and that. I am not hearing the specific allegation by this committee. What is it? It is not here. And that is the problem,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe story is, when this committee knew they were working with falsified evidence? That is the story.\u201d\n\nWednesday\u2019s hearing comes as a number of Republicans have become more openly critical of the probe, expressing doubt about whether it will lead to a formal impeachment trial.\n\nRepublicans invited two witnesses Wednesday with little connection to Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings.\n\nTop Stories from The Hill\n\nTony Bobulinski briefly worked with Hunter Biden, though the deal the two were working on never came to fruition. He later became aligned with allies of former President Trump, attending a presidential debate at his invitation. He is now represented by an attorney who represented numerous Trump White House aides before the Jan. 6 committee.\n\nJason Galanis, who is incarcerated on fraud charges brought in an indictment alongside Hunter Biden\u2019s former business partner, said he worked with the president\u2019s son, but that is in dispute; Hunter Biden said he only briefly met Galanis several years ago.\n\nBobulinski, in a heated exchange with Ocasio-Cortez, said he personally witnessed President Biden committing crimes, listing \u201ccorruption statues, RICO, and conspiracy, FARA\u201d in referencing racketeering laws and those that govern registering as a foreign agent.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear what activity Bobulinski would have witnessed that would qualify as a crime, and he has previously testified he had limited interactions with President Biden shortly after he left office.\n\nHe then added that the lawmaker was \u201cobviously not familiar with\u201d RICO.\n\n\u201cRICO is not a crime; it is a category; what is the crime,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez retorted.\n\nBobulinski grumbled about having to cite an exact statute and noted there are numerous lawyers on the committee.\n\nFederal RICO law, short for Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations, targets organized criminal activity and can be used to address a number of different crimes.\n\nIn addition to the federal law, several states have their own racketeering laws, including Georgia, where officials used the statute to charge former President Trump and other co-defendants in connection with Jan. 6.\n\nStory updated at 8:53 p.m.\n\nFOLLOW US ON GOOGLE NEWS\n\nRead original article here",

            "text": "Albemarle Lithium Auction offers a bold move forward in pricing transparency in the critical minerals market (March 20, 2024, Source ) \u2014 Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB), the largest lithium producer, is initiating a landmark auction on March 26 to enhance transparency and address price discovery issues in the lithium market. This move, highlighted by Jack Lifton of the Critical Minerals Institute (CMI), aims to mitigate the opacity and volatility that have long plagued the sector, exacerbated by the electric vehicle (EV) boom. Traditionally, lithium prices have been privately negotiated, lacking a clear global benchmark. Albemarle\u2019s auction represents an innovative step towards establishing more transparent pricing, inviting competitive bidding for a significant lithium quantity. Although this initiative marks progress towards addressing market challenges, Lifton cautions it may not fully resolve the industry\u2019s volatility and unpredictability, signaling a critical evolution in lithium pricing strategies amidst growing global demand.\n\nAnxiety Rises on the Future of Flow-Through Financings as METC Deadline Looms, Canadian Government Keeps Quiet (March 20, 2024, Source ) \u2014 Facing the potential expiration of the Mineral Exploration Tax Credit (METC) at the end of March, the Canadian mining industry is gripped by uncertainty. This credit, crucial for supporting exploration companies through Flow-Through Share pricing, might not be renewed, threatening to raise capital costs by 15-20%. The federal government\u2019s silence on the issue heightens anxiety, affecting planning and investments, especially for junior miners. Provincial credits in Ontario and Saskatchewan face similar fates, though Manitoba and British Columbia have permanent solutions. The industry is anxiously awaiting the federal budget announcement on April 16, hoping for a resolution. The potential loss of METC, combined with recent tax changes, could significantly impact exploration investment in Canada, underscoring the importance of government policy in the sector\u2019s financial health.\n\nUS pledges $1.28b for ASX rare earths stocks (March 21, 2024, Source ) \u2014 The US aims to allocate $1.28 billion to ASX-listed rare earths firms, Meteoric Resources NL (ASX: MEI) and Australian Strategic Materials Limited (ASX: ASM) (ASM), to diminish China\u2019s dominance in critical minerals necessary for decarbonization and defense. The US Export Import Bank\u2019s (US EXIM) potential loans aim to support projects in Brazil and New South Wales, contingent upon US companies obtaining project contracts. This funding is part of wider US and Australian efforts to establish non-Chinese critical mineral supply chains, with additional support from the US Department of Defence and other agencies for various projects. This initiative underscores the strategic importance of diversifying global supply chains and bolsters the credibility and development prospects of companies like Meteoric and ASM in the critical minerals sector.\n\nThis week\u2019s TMR Report also highlights several significant developments that further shape our understanding and approach to the critical minerals industry. The urging by the US Energy Secretary for Congress to ban uranium imports from Russia supports domestic nuclear fuel development, while China\u2019s rebound in graphite exports for batteries signals geopolitical tensions and strategic resource control. The US\u2019s efforts to incorporate Central Asia into its critical minerals supply chains, Indonesia\u2019s investment in a new HPAL plant by Vale to boost nickel production for EV batteries, and CATL\u2019s enduring ambitions despite a slight dip in quarterly earnings showcase the global landscape\u2019s complexity and interconnectedness. Furthermore, Graphjet Technology\u2019s innovative approach to producing greener graphite and the push to recognize phosphate and potash as critical minerals in the US underscore the ongoing efforts to secure and diversify supply chains. Lastly, Kazakhstan\u2019s emerging potential to rival China in the production of rare-earth metals points to the shifting dynamics of global supply and the continuous search for strategic alternatives to current market dominators.\n\nWelcome to the latest issue of the Technology Metals Report (TMR), brought to you by the Critical Minerals Institute (CMI). In this edition, we compile the most impactful stories shared by our CMI Director\u2019s over the past week, reflecting the dynamic and evolving nature of the critical minerals and technology metals industry. Among the key stories featured in this report are the US\u2019s pledge of $1.28 billion to ASX-listed rare earths firms to lessen China\u2019s dominance in the sector, the looming uncertainty over the future of Flow-Through Financings in Canada as the METC deadline approaches, and Albemarle Corporation\u2019s groundbreaking lithium auction aimed at enhancing pricing transparency. Additionally, the Biden administration\u2019s ambitious rule to expand electric vehicles (EVs) and the examination of factors behind cooling EV sales growth emphasize the ongoing transformations and challenges within the critical minerals sector.\n\nBiden Administration Announces Rule Aimed at Expanding Electric Vehicles (March 20, 2024, Source) \u2014 The Biden administration unveiled a pivotal climate regulation, aiming to revolutionize the U.S. auto industry by ensuring a majority of new passenger vehicles sold by 2032 are electric or hybrid. This marks a major step in tackling climate change, given transportation\u2019s status as the top carbon emitter in the country. Despite electric vehicles (EVs) constituting only 7.6% of car sales last year, this rule mandates a significant increase to meet a 56% EV sales target, with hybrids contributing an additional 16%. President Biden highlighted the initiative\u2019s potential for economic growth, job creation, and significant environmental benefits, including a projected reduction of over seven billion tons of carbon dioxide emissions over three decades. However, the transition faces challenges, including manufacturing and infrastructure overhaul, political opposition, and consumer acceptance. The regulation, which introduces stringent emissions caps, has garnered both support for its environmental impact and criticism for its feasibility and potential economic implications. Critics argue it may impose undue pressure on the auto industry and consumers, while supporters see it as a crucial step toward a more sustainable future.\n\nThe cars, the chargers or the customers? A look at what\u2019s behind cooling EV sales growth (March 20, 2024, Source) \u2014 Facing cooling growth in electric vehicle (EV) sales, automakers are adjusting their production strategies amidst increasing model availability. The sector balances optimism with skepticism regarding the shift away from fossil fuels, underlined by challenges like inadequate charging infrastructure impacting consumer choices. Events like CERAWeek by S&P Global highlight EVs\u2019 potential to reduce oil demand, emphasizing the transition\u2019s significance. Despite slower sales growth, companies like Ford report significant increases, pointing to the essential role of EVs in future automotive competitiveness. Addressing consumer concerns, particularly around charging reliability and infrastructure, alongside educating an evolving customer base, is pivotal for sustaining the industry\u2019s growth momentum.\n\nUS energy secretary encourages Congress to ban uranium supplies from Russia (March 20, 2024, Source) \u2014 U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm has urged Congress to ban uranium imports from Russia to support domestic nuclear fuel development. This call comes in light of legislation passed by the U.S. House last December, aimed at halting these imports as part of the response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. However, the Senate has faced delays due to a hold by Senator Ted Cruz on unrelated issues. Granholm emphasized that passing this ban would release funds for expanding domestic uranium enrichment and producing high assay low enriched uranium (HALEU) for advanced nuclear reactors. She expressed optimism during a House hearing on her department\u2019s budget, highlighting the urgency of this action to advance domestic nuclear energy capabilities.\n\nChina\u2019s exports of graphite for batteries rise from December low (March 20, 2024, Source) \u2014 China\u2019s natural graphite exports, essential for electric vehicle batteries, rebounded after Beijing\u2019s December controls aimed at tightening its grip on vital minerals for advanced manufacturing. From a December low of 3,973 tonnes, exports rose to 6,275 tonnes in January and 10,722 tonnes in February, despite previously averaging about 17,000 tonnes monthly. The restrictions, viewed as a response to Western trade barriers, notably impact trade flows. Rising tensions are evident as the U.S. considers blacklisting Chinese semiconductor firms linked to Huawei Technologies, signaling an escalation in the technological rivalry. These developments underscore the strategic importance of graphite in the global tech industry and the geopolitical tensions surrounding access to critical manufacturing resources.\n\nUS Looks to Draw Central Asia Into Critical Minerals Supply Chains (March 18, 2024, Source) \u2014 The United States is actively seeking to integrate Central Asia into its critical minerals supply chains, a move underscored by the February 2024 inauguration of the Critical Minerals Dialogue (CMD) in the C5+1 format. This initiative, bolstered by the collective will of the U.S. and Central Asian nations\u2014Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan\u2014aims to bolster Central Asia\u2019s role in global supply chains, thereby enhancing economic cooperation, facilitating clean energy transitions, and protecting regional ecosystems. Central Asia, rich in critical minerals like nickel, cobalt, palladium, rare earth elements (REEs), and others vital for high-tech, defense, and green technologies, represents a strategic alternative to China\u2019s dominance in these supply chains. The U.S. is particularly keen to mitigate risks associated with China\u2019s control over a significant portion of the world\u2019s critical minerals processing and production. Through the CMD and other partnerships, the U.S. seeks to foster investment in Central Asia\u2019s vast mineral resources, promising a potential shift in global economic and technological power dynamics while confronting strategic vulnerabilities and enhancing national security.\n\nIndonesia says nickel miner Vale to build another $2 bln HPAL plant (March 18, 2024, Source) \u2014 Nickel miner PT Vale Indonesia is considering a $1.91 billion investment in a new high-pressure acid leaching (HPAL) plant on Sulawesi island, announced Indonesia\u2019s Investment Ministry. This plant, named \u201cSOA HPAL,\u201d aims to produce mixed hydroxide precipitate (MHP), essential for electric vehicle batteries, with an expected annual output of 60,000 metric tons of nickel in MHP. Vale Indonesia, which is in the final stage of exploration, plans to collaborate with automakers for this venture. The company already has two HPAL projects underway in Sulawesi, partnering with Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt, and has Ford\u2019s involvement in the $4.5 billion Pomalaa project. Additionally, Indonesia\u2019s state mining company MIND ID recently acquired a 14% stake in Vale Indonesia, bolstering its position as a top shareholder.\n\nCATL earnings slip masks charged-up ambitions (March 18, 2024, Source) \u2014 Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world\u2019s largest electric car battery manufacturer, experienced a slight 1.2% decline in quarterly earnings, marking its first downturn since early 2022. Despite reduced factory utilization and the broader industry\u2019s cooling sales growth, CATL is ambitiously expanding, planning new facilities to increase its production potential significantly. The company dominates the global market, boasting a 36.8% share and leading innovation with a large R&D team focused on advanced battery chemistries. Although facing challenges in the United States, CATL is making strategic moves abroad, including constructing a factory in the European Union. Investors remain optimistic, reflected in a stock price increase, as CATL\u2019s scale, innovation, and strategic expansion position it to potentially outpace competition and maintain market leadership, despite potential overcapacity risks.\n\nStartup Offers EV Firms Greener Graphite in Alternative to China (March 18, 2024, Source) \u2014 Graphjet Technology, an alternative energy startup in Malaysia, is offering electric-vehicle (EV) manufacturers a sustainable source of graphite by converting agricultural waste into this critical battery component. Utilizing palm kernels, the company can produce graphite with an 83% lower carbon footprint and at 80% less cost than traditional methods. Starting in the second quarter, Graphjet aims for an annual production capacity of 3,000 tons from its facility in Malaysia, a leading palm oil producer. This move provides a significant alternative to China\u2019s dominance in the synthetic graphite market, responsible for 90% of the global supply. The U.S. is keen on diversifying its EV battery supply chain away from Chinese control, especially in light of China\u2019s recent export restrictions on graphite. Graphjet\u2019s initiative is timely, as it plans expansions in Nevada, Korea, Japan, and Europe, aiming to address the growing global demand and the U.S.\u2019s need for a reliable graphite source outside China.\n\nTFI: Phosphate and Potash are Critical Minerals, Senate Bill to Solidify (March 14, 2024, Source) \u2014 The Fertilizer Institute (TFI) has commended the U.S. Senate\u2019s bipartisan effort to classify phosphate and potash as critical minerals, highlighting the move as crucial for securing the nation\u2019s agricultural future and food supply. The legislation, backed by Senators from both parties, aims to ensure a resilient and sustainable domestic fertilizer supply for American agriculture by addressing the vulnerabilities in the global supply chain and geopolitical instability. With the majority of the world\u2019s phosphate and potash concentrated in a few countries, and the U.S. heavily reliant on imports for its potash needs, this initiative seeks to mitigate supply chain risks. Recognizing these minerals as critical could streamline the permitting process for expanding and opening new mines in the U.S., a necessary step given the extensive time and financial investment required.\n\nKazakhstan\u2019s Potential to Overtake China in Production of Rare-Earth Metals (March 14, 2024, Source) \u2014 Kazakhstan is on the verge of becoming a significant contender in the global rare-earth elements (REEs) market, challenging China\u2019s dominance. With China controlling 70% of the market and facing strained relations with the West, North American and European investors are turning to Kazakhstan\u2019s rich reserves as a strategic alternative. This shift is driven by the need to diversify supply chains away from China, given REEs\u2019 critical role in technology and manufacturing. The US and EU are prepared to invest in Kazakhstan, aiming to secure a stable, sustainable supply of these vital materials. However, Kazakhstan must modernize its mining practices and carefully select investors to fully leverage its potential as a global REE supplier.\n\nInvestor.News Critical Minerals Media Coverage:\n\nMarch 20, 2024 \u2013 Anxiety Rises on the Future of Flow-Through Financings as METC Deadline Looms, Canadian Government Keeps Quiet https://bit.ly/3IKHmI7\n\nMarch 20, 2024 \u2013 Albemarle Lithium Auction offers a bold move forward in pricing transparency in the critical minerals market https://bit.ly/3vkpBwf\n\nMarch 20, 2024 \u2013 The Top 5 Reasons Why YouTube Will Transform Marketing for Public Companies https://bit.ly/3PvPnEC\n\nInvestor.News Critical Minerals Videos:\n\nMarch 20, 2024 \u2013 CBLT\u2019S Peter Clausi on de-risking exploration projects with M&A https://bit.ly/3vfU6Uf\n\nMarch 20, 2024 \u2013 Chris Buncic on the \u201cshocking\u201d Chrysalis Copper timeline for production https://bit.ly/49ZGRGm\n\nMarch 19, 2024 \u2013 World Renowned Critical Minerals Expert Constantine Karayannopoulos is Bullish on Lithium https://bit.ly/43mOvbk\n\nMarch 19, 2024 \u2013 Peartree\u2019s Ron Bernbaum on how Charitable Flow-Through Financings Connects Donors, Investors, and Mining Companies for Canada\u2019s Exploration Capital https://bit.ly/4cj303V\n\nMarch 19, 2024 \u2013 Xcite Resources\u2019 Jean-Francois Meilleur on the Athabasca Basin\u2019s untapped potential for significant uranium discoveries https://bit.ly/49YQ9SK\n\nMarch 19, 2024 \u2013 Scandium Canada\u2019s Guy Bourassa on One of the Largest Primary Scandium Projects in the World https://bit.ly/3TlHeUp\n\nMarch 18, 2024 \u2013 Rowena Smith Highlights ASM\u2019s Operational Success at Korean Metals Plant in Rare Earth Metals Production https://bit.ly/3TH1jWS\n\nMarch 18, 2024 \u2013 Jack Lifton Sits Down with \u2018Bobby\u2019 Stewart, the Driving Force Behind Geophysx Jamaica\u2019s Charge into the Global Arena with Critical Minerals https://bit.ly/3vhDtaG\n\nMarch 18, 2024 \u2013 WEALTH\u2019s Peter Nicholson on the Added Benefits of Critical Mineral Flow Through Investment Deals in Quebec, Saskatchewan and Manitoba https://bit.ly/4a37xGk\n\nMarch 17, 2024 \u2013 John Passalacqua on First Phosphate\u2019s groundbreaking achievements in the phosphate mining industry https://bit.ly/3VgRlwt\n\nMarch 17, 2024 \u2013 America Rare Earths\u2019 Donald Swartz on the recent increase in in-situ resources at Halleck Creek by 64% to 2.34 billion tonnes https://bit.ly/3IGgvNv\n\nMarch 17, 2024 \u2013 Rowena Smith sits down with Jack Lifton on ASM\u2019s \u2018Mines to Metal\u2019 Advantage in Supplying Rare Earths https://bit.ly/4cmIlMc\n\nCritical Minerals IN8.Pro Member News Releases:",

Each measure will be difficult to pass in a divided Congress. Republican candidate Donald Trump has previously supported red flag laws but opposed broader measures favored by Biden.",

Crude oil production in the United States, including condensate, averaged 12.9 million barrels per day (b/d) in 2023, breaking the previous U.S. and global record of 12.3 million b/d, set in 2019. Average monthly U.S. crude oil production established a monthly record high in December 2023 at more than 13.3 million b/d.\n\nThe crude oil production record in the United States in 2023 is unlikely to be broken in any other country in the near term because no other country has reached production capacity of 13.0 million b/d. Saudi Arabia\u2019s state-owned Saudi Aramco recently scrapped plans to increase production capacity to 13.0 million b/d by 2027.\n\nTogether, the United States, Russia, and Saudi Arabia accounted for 40% (32.8 million b/d) of global oil production in 2023. These three countries have produced more oil than any others since 1971 (counting production in the Russian Federation of the Soviet Union prior to 1991), although the top spot has shifted among them over the past five decades. By comparison, the next three largest producing countries\u2014Canada, Iraq, and China\u2014combined produced 13.1 million b/d in 2023, only slightly more than what was produced in the United States alone.\n\nData source: U.S. Energy Information Administration, International Energy Statistics\n\nAfter peaking at 9.6 million b/d in 1970, annual U.S. crude oil production flattened and then generally declined for decades to a low of 5.0 million b/d in 2008. Crude oil production in the United States began increasing again in 2009, as producers increasingly applied hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling techniques, and has increased steadily since. The only exception to U.S. production growth since 2009 was in 2020 and 2021, when demand and prices decreased because of the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. In recent years, crude oil production in the Permian Basin (in western Texas and eastern New Mexico) drove the increases in total crude oil and natural gas production in the United States. Russia was the country with the most crude oil production in 2017, but production growth in Russia has since lagged behind the United States. Average annual production in Russia peaked in 2019 at 10.8 million b/d, when it trailed the United States by 1.4 million b/d. More recently, Russia was among the OPEC+ countries that announced production cuts in November 2022, and in February 2023, it separately announced additional voluntary cuts of 500,000 b/d. Although voluntary cuts have reduced recent production in Russia, we believe sanctions and voluntary actions by companies in response to the full-scale invasion of Ukraine have been the primary cause of the cuts. Actual cuts to production appear to be smaller than anticipated, however, and we estimate that production in Russia declined by only 200,000 b/d in 2023. Average annual production in Saudi Arabia peaked in 2022 at 10.6 million b/d, which was 1.3 million b/d less than in the United States that year. In 2023, crude oil production in Saudi Arabia declined by about 900,000 b/d because of OPEC+ cuts and further voluntary cuts Saudi Arabia made to offset weaker demand growth. Production in Saudi Arabia could not exceed the 2023 production volume in the United States because state-owned Saudi Aramco\u2019s stated production capacity is 12.0 million b/d, with about 300,000 b/d of additional capacity from its share of the Neutral Zone area shared with Kuwait.

This has been largely due to improvements in oil recovery from both new and existing wells\u2026\n\nWhile virtually all of the Permian Basin of Texas is under private or state lands, where Biden has no control, much of New Mexico\u2019s portion of the Permian Basin is on Federal lands. Democrats at the state and Federal levels have been slowly restricting leasing and drilling in New Mexico:\n\nDecisions by federal and state officials last week will limit where New Mexico\u2019s powerful oil and gas industry is able to drill. On Friday, Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland announced that the department will soon ban new oil and gas leases on more than 330,000 acres of public lands within a 10-mile radius of Chaco Culture National Historical Park \u2014 a UNESCO World Heritage Site of deep cultural importance to the region\u2019s Pueblo and Tribal nations. The day before, the New Mexico Commissioner of Public Lands instituted a moratorium on new oil and gas leases on state trust lands within one mile of schools, daycare centers, and sporting fields used by students. Grist\n\nIronically, oil and gas revenues currently account for about 1/3 of the state\u2019s education budget.\n\nGulf of Mexico\n\nThe second most prolific region, the Federal waters of the Gulf of Mexico, has seen no growth in production due to the Biden maladministration\u2019s war on oil & gas leasing, permitting and drilling\u2026\n\nOffshore oil and gas permitting plummets to 2-decade low under Biden Without stable permitting and leasing, producers may leave for \u2018regions with a more predictable regulatory environment,\u2019 industry group says By Thomas Catenacci Fox News Published October 12, 2023 11:41am EDT Offshore oil and gas permitting under President Biden has fallen to a low the energy industry has not experienced since the Bush administration two decades ago, according to federal data reviewed by Fox News Digital. Since January 2021, when Biden took office, the federal government has approved applications for permit to drill on just 157 new wells, according to the data compiled by Department of the Interior\u2019s Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE). The figure represents a 29% decline compared to the same period under the Trump administration and a 55% decline compared to the same period under the Obama administration. \u201cPolicymakers should leverage the Gulf of Mexico to help meet growing global oil demand,\u201d Erik Milito, the president of the National Ocean Industries Association, told Fox News Digital. \u201cThe Gulf of Mexico is a prime example of doing more with less.\u201d \u201cWe were producing more than 2 million barrels of oil per day in the Gulf of Mexico prior to the pandemic, despite the number of active lease blocks being much lower than they were 5, 10, or 15 years ago,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe produce a massive amount of energy with a small footprint. However, bottlenecking the permitting process is a surefire way to discourage the success of the region despite growing global demand.\u201d [\u2026]Fox News\n\nThe most recent malfeasance was an attempt to essentially halt all future leasing on the shelf edge to protect a fake whale species.\n\nRice\u2019s whales are primarily located in the yellow and back outlined area in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico, an area off-limits to oil & gas exploration. The Biden administration attempted to illegally remove the \u201cRice\u2019s Whale Expanded Area\u201d (dark blue area on map below) from this, and all future, lease sales.\n\nWhen Lease Sale 261 was finally held after numerous court orders, it drew the most interest since 2015.\n\nLease Sale 261 brings in more than $382 million in high bids Dec. 20, 2023 Lease Sale 261 reported to be the largest oil and gas lease auction since 2015. Offshore staff NEW ORLEANS \u2013 The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) reports that Lease Sale 261 generated $382,168,507 in high bids for 311 tracts covering 1.7 million acres in federal waters in the US Gulf of Mexico. BOEM says that a total of 26 companies participated in the lease sale, submitting 352 bids totaling $441,896,332. Among the winners were Chevron, BP, Shell, Equinor, Repsol, Woodside Energy, Occidental Petroleum, Murphy Oil, Talos Energy, and Kosmos Energy. [\u2026]Offshore Magazine\n\nThe red blocks indicate leases that drew bids in Sale 261.\n\nWhile the lamestream media incessantly tries to credit Biden for record US oil production, the fact is that his maladministration has routinely flouted the law in their treasonous war on the US oil & gas industry\u2026\n\nBiden: I Wanted \u2018to Stop All Drilling\u2019 on the Coasts and Gulf, Got Blocked by Courts by IAN HANCHETT 8 Aug 2023 During an interview with The Weather Channel that is set to air on Wednesday, a portion of which aired on Tuesday, President Joe Biden said that he \u201cwanted to stop all drilling on the East Coast and the West Coast and in the Gulf\u201d but was blocked by the courts from doing so.

Latest polling reveals the financial system as Arizona voters\u2019 No. 2 concern after immigration.\n\nElevate Your Tech Prowess with Excessive-Worth Talent Programs Providing School Course Web site Indian Faculty of Enterprise ISB Skilled Certificates in Product Administration Go to IIM Lucknow IIML Government Programme in FinTech, Banking & Utilized Threat Administration Go to MIT MIT Expertise Management and Innovation Go to\n\nAlong with the close-fought contest between Biden and Republican challenger Donald Trump, Arizona voters will probably be selecting a successor to retiring Senator Kyrsten Sinema, a Democrat-turned-independent, and deciding two extremely aggressive races for Home of Representatives seats now held by Republicans.\n\n\u201cThe potential may very well be unbiased voters,\u201d stated Thom Reilly, a professor at Arizona State College\u2019s Faculty of Public Affairs, who famous that independents are the state\u2019s largest voting bloc and represented about 40% of voters within the 2022 midterm elections.\n\n\u201cIndependents got here out in important numbers for Democrats in 2022,\u201d stated Reilly, who added that Wednesday\u2019s information might carry weight with the state\u2019s giant and rising numbers of youth and Hispanic voters, in addition to California transplants.\n\nThe funds come from the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, which slated round $52 billion in federal authorities subsidies to assist the home manufacturing of semiconductors, coupled with about $24 billion price of funding tax credit.\n\nUncover the tales of your curiosity\n\n\n\nAlong with Arizona, funds will go to Ohio, residence to a different key Senate race, New Mexico and Oregon. Intel estimated the brand new vegetation will create 3,000 new jobs within the firm and one other 6,000 spots for the development employees who construct them. Arizona will play a important position in figuring out whether or not Democrats can defend their slim 51-49 majority within the Senate. The race will pit Democratic U.S. Consultant Ruben Gallego towards Republican former tv broadcaster Kari Lake, a vocal Trump supporter.\n\nTight Contest\n\nBiden gained Arizona in a good 2020 race towards Trump. A Feb. 22 Emerson School ballot of 1,000 registered voters within the state had Trump main Biden 46% to 43%, which is inside the margin of error of three share factors. In that very same ballot, Gallego led Lake 46% to 39%, with 15% undecided.\n\nIntel stated the brand new, expanded amenities will probably be within the metropolis of Chandler, about 20 miles (32 km) southeast of Phoenix. That places it inside driving distance of the state\u2019s two best Home districts. With Republicans holding a slim 219-213 majority, a couple of modifications might flip management of the chamber.\n\nEach these seats are held by Republicans, Representatives David Schweikert and Juan Ciscomani, who\u2019re anticipated to face robust races towards Democrats. Republicans and Democrats maintain their main elections on July 30.\n\nOfficers with the 2 campaigns didn\u2019t instantly reply to requests for remark.\n\nSchweikert, who gained reelection in 2022 by 3,200 votes, voted towards the huge semiconductor funding invoice, as did most of his Home Republican colleagues.\n\nCiscomani is a first-term Republican who was not in Congress in 2022. Gallego voted in favor of the invoice.\n\n\u201cAnytime you may ship precise outcomes to an organization and a state \u2026 it is a internet constructive,\u201d stated Jessica Taylor, an editor on the nonpartisan Prepare dinner Political Report.\n\nShe added that whether or not Democrats truly achieve votes relies upon partially on how efficient the White Home is in speaking going ahead. That\u2019s an space that the Biden administration has come below criticism for and the president himself has expressed frustrations over.\n\n\u201cWhat sort of economics are folks involved about? Issues like this or extra like kitchen-table points,\u201d Taylor stated referring to client costs and inflation. \u201cThat is the largest hurdle that they\u2019ve with undecided voters.\u201d",

Missouri, a Supreme Court case that originated from a lawsuit filed by state attorneys general from Missouri and Louisiana accusing government officials of colluding with social media companies to censor posts online.\n\nBILL MAHER, JOHN CLEESE RAIL AGAINST THE NEW YORK TIMES: \u2018SAD\u2019 IT\u2019S NO LONGER A \u2018GREAT NEWSPAPER\u2019\n\nThese allegedly censored posts included statements about COVID-19 and Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop, among other topics.\n\nSwisher pushed back on Maher\u2019s points, noting that it was a confusing time for everyone.\n\nMaher said earlier in the interview that he \u201cwas always on the page during the pandemic that they should not be shutting down debate about medical matters.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was a dissenter on many of these issues,\u201d he said, before noting that there were valuable opinions that were silenced or discouraged at the height of the pandemic.\n\nFacebook \u2014 now Meta \u2014 owner Mark Zuckerberg said last year that the \u201cestablishment\u2026 kind of waffled on a bunch of facts and asked for a bunch of things to be censored that, in retrospect, ended up being more debatable or true.\u201d\n\nOn \u201cReal Time,\u201d Swisher told Maher that \u201cwe\u2019re not going to know perfectly.\u201d\n\nThe host continued, providing examples of where speech on the topic was discouraged.\n\n\u201cOK, but we should have been able to argue about whether it came from a lab, which we weren\u2019t. Things like that,\u201d he said. \u201cNatural immunity \u2014 whether it was better to go to the beach and get sun and fresh air, as I would have said, as opposed to sitting home and day-drinking and putting on weight.\u201d\n\nREP.

My question was always, \u2018Why are your doctors more important than my doctors, the ones I want to listen to?'\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the social media companies were in the tank with the government,\u201d Maher said.",

Nor is there any evidence that Trump, as he claimed, has plans to use any of his own money for his presidential campaign.)\n\nBut also embedded in the posts was a reality that has pushed Trump\u2019s company and personal finances to the brink with just two days remaining to land a solution.\n\nTrump, as he himself noted, does have a significant amount of cash, according to a review of his most recent candidate financial disclosure and personal financial statements.\n\nIt\u2019s a point he made repeatedly in his deposition and testimony during the New York fraud trial though that diverged from his latest social media claim of having \u201calmost five hundred million dollars in cash.\u201d He consistently pegged the number during legal proceedings at $400 million and, barring any recent and unreported cash infusion, a person familiar with his finances confirmed that remains roughly where his cash holdings stand.\n\nYet even if the higher-end estimate is accurate, as Trump\u2019s lawyers have made clear in sober, detailed filings, it wouldn\u2019t be enough.\n\nThe $464 million decision levied in the verdict, and the bond Trump is scrambling to secure to forestall potential seizure of his properties, would require cash or cash equivalent of roughly $557 million based on industry practice.\n\nAnd at least some of the money Trump does have is tied up in loan agreements that include terms requiring him to have tens of millions of dollars in cash on hand.\n\nIn other words, as the clock ticks toward the Monday deadline, securing a bond of the scale required remains \u2013 to quote Trump\u2019s own lawyers \u2013 a \u201cpractical impossibility.\u201d\n\nA deft strategy\n\nTrump\u2019s deft navigation of \u2013 and ability to leverage \u2013 his unprecedented collision of the campaign and courthouse has defined the path he bulldozed to once again become the Republican Party\u2019s presumptive presidential nominee.\n\nBut it was a filing by New York state lawyers at a county clerk\u2019s office 25 miles north of Trump Tower that demonstrated how perilously close the former president is to a dramatic derailment of that strategy.\n\nThe move by James\u2019 office to enter judgments in Westchester County marked a first step toward seizing Trump\u2019s assets should he fail to secure a bond.\n\nWestchester County is home to Trump\u2019s golf course and private estate known as Seven Springs.\n\nThe initial action, which state lawyers already took in Manhattan, is just the start to what would be a complex and lengthy process.\n\nIt also came as Trump\u2019s lawyers have continued to press to reduce or waive the bond requirement, calling it \u201cpatently unreasonable, unjust and unconstitutional,\u201d in a Wednesday filing.\n\nBut for Trump, a man who has made his brand and his buildings his central animating feature, the filing that put a target on one of his properties crystalized a moment unlike any other he\u2019s faced in his White House comeback bid.\n\n\u201cI think the whole thing is bullsh*t,\u201d one House Republican, who communicates with Trump\u2019s team said of the order to secure the $464 million bond while waiting for a decision on his appeal. \u201cBut it had gotten to the point where it seemed like nothing will ever stick to him, so this has been different.\u201d\n\nIn other words, there may be actual consequences.\n\nEnduring GOP support\n\nOver nearly a year, as four indictments and 88 charges piled on, Trump\u2019s poll numbers in the GOP primary tracked a steady climb.\n\nDays when Trump faced charges, or showed up at court to face those charges, consistently ranked among his best fundraising days on the campaign.\n\nThat money, in part, has covered Trump\u2019s legal bills so he wouldn\u2019t have to on his own.\n\nThe lawyers that money financed have been both unequivocal about their pursuit of dilatory strategies \u2013 and have repeatedly succeeded in those efforts.\n\nIf, as countless former campaign officials say, presidential candidates\u2019 most valuable asset is their time, Trump\u2019s decision to repeatedly attend court hearings when his presence wasn\u2019t required made clear his view of the incentives. So did the voters.\n\nTrump successfully cut down \u2013 with relative ease \u2013 the best financed and most politically gifted of his primary challengers. He all but locked up the GOP nomination after just two primary contests as the party largely fell in line behind a candidate under whose tenure it lost the House, the Senate and the White House.\n\nTrump was also the same candidate whom some publicly \u2013 and many more privately \u2013 had hoped would simply disappear after the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol and the steady stream of revelations that he and his advisers had sought to overturn Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 victory.\n\nPeople around Trump say they\u2019ve seen no sign of any political damage from his latest legal stress test. National polls continue to show a margin-of-error contest with Biden, and more importantly, surveys in the critical swing states haven\u2019t revealed a tangible shift. New CNN polling conducted by SSRS in two battleground states showed Trump tied with Biden in Pennsylvania at 46% each, and ahead in Michigan, 50% to 42%.\n\nBiden flipped both states from Trump\u2019s column in 2020.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign apparatus trails Biden\u2019s team significantly in fundraising, but those around Trump are confident that the gap will be closed. The former president, these people say, has been privately working the party\u2019s biggest donors in a way they haven\u2019t seen before.\n\n\u201cThe money will be there,\u201d one person told CNN. \u201cHe\u2019s never been more focused or effective on that front than he is right now.\u201d\n\nOne adviser mused that any pursuit of Trump\u2019s properties would only serve to help the campaign politically, pointing to email and text donation appeals with lines like \u201cKeep your filthy hands off Trump Tower!\u201d as evidence to that effect.\n\nA cash dilemma\n\nStill, the threat Trump currently faces cuts equally to his political and personal core. It\u2019s also one that carries a level of irony.\n\nIn a career, and now verdict, beset by a steady stream of questions about his net worth and the value of his substantial real estate assets, Trump does have a significant amount of cash \u2013 and a valuable portfolio of properties, which could more than cover the bond amount.\n\nBut insurers rarely take real estate as collateral, fearing a complex process and skewed market where any bids on that property would come from entities well aware of the need to sell, Trump\u2019s lawyers said.\n\nOne insurer, Chubb, underwrote a $91.63 million bond just two weeks ago in another Trump legal loss \u2013 E. Jean Carroll\u2019s defamation case.\n\nTrump\u2019s team had been in discussions with Chubb over a second bond for the fraud case that included a mix of liquid assets and property. In the past week, the insurer informed Trump\u2019s team it could not accept property as collateral.\n\nIn total, 30 insurers contacted by Trump\u2019s team declined to pursue the effort to secure a bond. Trump, in a Truth Social posting, alluded to that fact when he noted that it \u201cis not possible for bonding companies to do in such a high amount, before I can even Appeal. That is CRAZY! If I sold assets, and then won the Appeal, the assets would be forever gone.\u201d\n\nThere has been a steady stream of rumors about some of Trump\u2019s richest backers stepping in to put up the cash.\n\nBut so far there has been no confirmation of concrete requests, let alone movement toward any agreement.\n\nAnother potential pathway that Trump allies have discussed opened up Friday when investors approved a merger that made the former president\u2019s media enterprise, Trump Media and Technology Group, a public company. Trump\u2019s holdings in the new company would, on their face, net him billions in stock.\n\nBut the availability of that cash from the parent company of Truth Social would be subject to a six month \u201clockup\u201d period that would hamstring Trump\u2019s ability to sell any shares or use them as collateral. The billions Trump stands to gain exist only on paper \u2013 and would be subject to the price fluctuations of the stock when it starts to trade.\n\nAny effort by Trump to get around that lockup period in order to monetize his shares would likely have a direct, and negative, effect on the stock\u2019s price.\n\nWatching his image\n\nTrump has repeatedly dismissed the idea of pursuing bankruptcy, which would freeze the proceedings for what would likely be an extended period of time.\n\nThe reasons, advisers say, cut across personal and political concerns.\n\nTrump has been publicly vocal about the deep scars he carries from bankruptcies decades ago.\n\n\u201cIt was an experience that I don\u2019t think I want to go through it again,\u201d Trump said in a 1992 interview with Charlie Rose. \u201cYou\u2019re really in a position where I think that if you had to do it again, I\u2019m not sure you could. I went through a period of two years that was truly tough.\u201d\n\nTrump is also cognizant of the potential threat it could pose to his carefully crafted image that sits at the heart of his political salience: that of a billionaire business tycoon.\n\n\u201cNo chance,\u201d one adviser said of Trump pursuing bankruptcy. \u201cHe\u2019d rather have Letitia James show up and try and seize his properties.\u201d\n\nWhether that version of the campaign and courthouse convergence plays out will be made clear in the days ahead.\n\nFor now, however, it has become clear as the deadline to secure the bond looms ever closer, that the playbook that has driven Trump\u2019s political comeback has run into hurdles in the form of hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nThat\u2019s a problem the only political opponent who has ever defeated Trump is happy to highlight.\n\n\u201cI know not everyone is feeling the enthusiasm,\u201d Biden joked at a Dallas fundraising reception this week. \u201cJust the other day a defeated-looking man came up to me and said, \u2018Mr. President, I have crushing debt, and I\u2019m completely wiped out.\u2019 And I had to look at him and say, \u2018Donald, I\u2019m sorry.

            "text": "At a recent fundraising event in Houston, Texas, President Joe Biden openly mocked his predecessor, Donald Trump, for suggesting in 2020 that disinfectants could potentially treat COVID-19. This controversial statement by Trump had previously compelled the manufacturers of household cleaning products like Lysol and Dettol to issue public warnings against the ingestion of their products.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nThe Controversial Statement\n\nDuring the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, Trump speculated about the effectiveness of sunlight and disinfectant in fighting the virus, even pondering aloud during a press briefing if these could be used internally in humans. This led to widespread criticism and concern, prompting health experts and product manufacturers to urgently warn the public against following such dangerous advice.\n\nIn his address to supporters, Biden did not hesitate to ridicule Trump's past comments, suggesting humorously that Trump might have tried his own advice. The former president's handling of the pandemic, including his personal bout with the virus and the subsequent infection of nearly 900 Secret Service agents, was used by Biden to underscore the recklessness of Trump's leadership during a critical time.\n\nImplications and Public Health Concerns\n\nThe incident highlights the importance of responsible communication from leaders, especially during public health crises. Biden's criticism not only serves as a political jab but also reminds the public of the potentially dangerous consequences of misinformation. This episode is a stark reminder of the challenges faced in combating COVID-19 misinformation, emphasizing the need for vigilance against unverified medical advice.",

Nowhere is this causing more concern than for the countries in the Baltic states -- Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. Photo by Mike Theiler/UPI | License Photo\n\nMarch 22 (UPI) -- With Donald Trump leading in many of the polls for the upcoming U.S. presidential election, his comments about global security and foreign policy have to be taken seriously. In February, Trump flippantly remarked that he would encourage Russia to do whatever it wanted to NATO states that failed to pay their bills. In a follow-up interview on GB News this week, he warned allies \"not to take advantage\" of the United States. Advertisement\n\nNowhere is this causing more concern than for the countries in the Baltic states -- Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.\n\nNot only does Trump, sometimes, say he wants to halt all U.S. military aid to Ukraine, but Trump wants to undercut Article 5 of NATO's treaty -- the principle of collective defense -- something that has become increasingly important in the wake of Russia's aggression. British military sources are worried that Trump's remarks will strengthen Russian President Vladimir Putin's resolve over Ukraine, and could result in him advancing on even more territory.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven before Trump emerged on the U.S. political scene, the Baltic countries have been especially concerned about Russia's growing ambitions. They have, after all, been invaded and occupied by Russia before, in 1940, and then forced to become part of the Soviet Union. There are plenty of people who can still remember life in the Soviet Union.\n\nSince Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, the Baltic states have been the loudest voices sounding the alarm about the existential threat posed by Russia, and all three countries increased their military spending to more than 2% of their GDP, and recently agreed to raise it to 3%.\n\nBuilding shared defenses\n\nAmid growing security concerns, the defense ministers in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia also agreed in January to set up a common Baltic defense zone on their borders with Russia and Belarus. This would consist of building physical defensive structures such as bunkers.\n\nEstonia will begin construction of 600 bunkers in early 2025. The nations will also cooperate in developing missile artillery, and ensuring that their equipment, ammunition and manpower is updated.\n\nEstonia has also doubled the size of its territorial defense force to 20,000 people, while Latvia reintroduced conscription in 2023 after becoming the only Baltic state to stop mandatory military service in 2006.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLatvia also plans to double the size of its armed forces to 61,000 by the year 2032. Meanwhile, Lithuania has made an agreement with Germany to allow a permanent brigade of 4,800 of its troops to be combat ready on the Russian border by 2027.\n\nPutin's pledge\n\nBut given that Russia borders 14 countries, why are the Baltic states especially concerned about their security? In addition to being geographically close, a notable number of ethnic Russians live in the Baltic countries (5% in Lithuania; 25% in Estonia and 36% in Latvia). In the eastern Estonian city of Narva, 95.7% of the population are native Russian speakers and 87.7% are ethnic Russians.\n\nThis matters as Putin has argued that having substantial numbers of ethnic Russians living outside Russia, due to the \"catastrophic\" dissolution of the Soviet Union, represents a \"humanitarian disaster of epic proportions\" as it left Russians cut off from \"their motherland.\" Putin has vowed to actively protect all \"Russians\" living abroad.\n\nIn particular, Putin has said he was concerned about how ethnic Russians are being treated in the Baltics, remarking that the deportation of ethnic Russians (most notably in Latvia, where there have been recent changes to its immigration laws), poses a threat to Russian national security.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Kremlin has also protested the demolition of Soviet monuments in the Baltics, placing Estonia's prime minster, Kaja Kallas, on its wanted list for doing so.\n\nBut these claims about wanting to protect Russians abroad are really just a pretext to justify escalation with the Baltics, which will test NAT's alliance and destabilize the organization. So it's not just important that there are ethnic Russians living there -- there are strategic reasons as well that make them an easy target.\n\nEven with the Baltic countries strengthening their troop numbers, Russia has 1.32 million active military personnel, and 2 million active reserve. Combined, this is greater that Lithuania's entire population of 2.8 million people, and far greater than Estonia and Latvia, which have populations of 1.3 million and 1.8 million people, respectively.\n\nFor Lithuania, which borders Belarus and Russian-run mini-state Kaliningrad, there are concerns that it could be taken over first by Russian forces, which would then physically isolate Lithuania from the rest of the Baltics. The Kaliningrad region has become increasingly militarized in recent years, with Iskander ballistic missiles and S-400 systems installed. With Trump suggesting he would weaken the United States' commitment to NATO if elected, there won't be much of a deterrent for Putin to grab low-hanging fruit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe current NATO response force consists of about 40,000 troops, with plans to upgrade to 300,000 troops. But quick-reaction units could still be too slow to protect the Baltics from Russian forces as, ironically, moving large units, vehicles and ammunition across borders is bureaucratic and takes time. It would be important to have excellent intelligence and to move quickly, something that will be made more difficult with the United States potentially opting out of its commitments.\n\nThough Russia has plunged much of its resources into winning the Ukraine war, Putin still aims to expand Russian sovereignty across the post-Soviet states and to effectively dismantle NATO, something that Trump takes no issue with. As Russia has been ramping up its war machine, the Baltic states firmly believe that Russian aggression will not stop at Ukraine, and that they could be next.\n\nNatasha Lindstaedt is a professor in the government department at the University of Essex.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

This photo by Colleen Benelli is licensed under CC BY 2.0.\n\nJuneau, Alaska (KINY) \u2013 The Department of Commerce and NOAA announced plans to allocate $60 million in funding to advance tribal priorities and address the impacts of climate change on Pacific salmon and steelhead in the Columbia River as part of President Biden\u2019s Investing in America agenda. These funds from the Inflation Reduction Act \u2014 the largest climate investment in history \u2014 will also play a crucial role in addressing deferred maintenance and repairs at Mitchell Act-funded hatchery facilities across the Columbia River Basin.\n\nThis funding is consistent with President Biden\u2019s September 2023 Memorandum on Restoring Healthy and Abundant Salmon, Steelhead, and Other Native Fish Populations in the Columbia River Basin and the historic December 14, 2023 agreement between the four lower Columbia River Treaty Tribes, the States of Oregon and Washington (collectively known as the six sovereigns) and the relevant agencies and departments of the United States promising to work together in partnership to restore these species in the Basin.\n\n\u201cThis effort aligns with the U.S. government\u2019s commitment to the Columbia Basin Restoration Initiative,\u201d said U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo. \u201cThe funding will prioritize tribal initiatives, building upon extensive tribal engagement efforts, to strengthen projects aimed at enhancing climate resilience for tribal fisheries and salmon recovery efforts.\u201d\n\nThis funding was first announced in June 2023 as part of the historic $3.3 billion in investments focused on ensuring America\u2019s communities and economies are ready for and resilient to climate change. Of that $3.3 billion, an additional $240 million will support Pacific coastal salmon restoration and recovery through investment in non-Mitchell Act hatcheries, and $42 million will support Pacific salmon populations through the Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery Fund and expanded research programs to identify and prioritize restoration strategies. NOAA is also continuing work to reopen migratory pathways and restore access to healthy habitat for fish.\n\nNOAA Fisheries worked closely with hatchery operators to identify critical deferred maintenance and repairs required for facilities. NOAA collaborated with tribal, state and federal Mitchell Act hatchery program operators to strategize the most effective allocation of funding. Together, these groups identified a range of projects focused on hatchery deferred maintenance and repair activities to ensure the long-term health and sustainability of fisheries in the region.\n\n\u201cThis funding from the Inflation Reduction Act reaffirms our commitment to tribal and treaty rights through revitalizing the salmon, steelhead and other native fish populations within the Columbia River Basin,\u201d stated Janet Coit, assistant administrator for NOAA Fisheries. \u201cThese funds will support salmon fisheries that have long been the lifeblood of tribes along the Columbia River.\u201d\n\nThe Mitchell Act was passed by Congress in 1938 for the conservation of salmon and steelhead fishery resources in the Columbia River Basin in light of hydroelectric, irrigation and flood control development projects across the basin. It authorized the establishment, operation and maintenance of hatchery facilities in Oregon, Washington and Idaho, as well as other fishery conservation activities. Since 1946, Congress has annually appropriated Mitchell Act funds.\n\nPlease visit NOAA\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law websites to learn about current and future funding opportunities.",

The Biden administration overall has canceled student debt for over 870,000 public service workers, which is $62.5 billion in debt forgiven, according to the White House\u2019s announcement.\n\nThe public service workers receiving loans are set to receive an emailed message with the news, signed by Biden.\n\n20% of students use financial aid for betting: experts\n\n\n\n\u201cBecause you\u2019ve pursued a career in public service, you\u2019re on track to get your eligible student loans forgiven in less than a year through Public Service Loan Forgiveness,\u201d the message reads.\n\nThe relief is a result of fixes that the Biden administration made to the PSLF program, which is a program that Education Sec. Miguel Cardona described in a statement that previously had \u201clogistical troubles and trap doors.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday, more than 100 times more borrowers are eligible for PSLF than there were at the beginning of the Administration. The Biden Administration is turning a promise broken under our predecessor into a promise kept,\u201d Cardona said.\n\nIn January, the Biden administration announced it would forgive $3.2 billion for those on the PSLF program. At the time, it had forgiven $56.7 billion for 793,400 PSLF borrowers.\n\nOverall, as of January, it had forgiven the debt held by more than 3.7 million student loan borrowers through either PSLF or other avenues, such as fixes in income-driven repayment (IDR) options.\n\nRead original article here",

Ron DeSantis, Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a major Trump critic.\n\nYass has not previously donated to Trump. A spokesperson for Yass declined to comment for this article.\n\nYass' political contributions have soared from the levels he spent in previous elections, OpenSecrets data shows. In the entire 2016 election cycle, for example, Yass and his wife donated just over $5 million \u2013 a ninth of his donations in the current cycle, which wraps up with the Nov. 5 general election.\n\nHis donations this cycle have included some $16 million to the Club for Growth Action, a super PAC funding group linked to the fiscally conservative Club for Growth non-profit. The Club for Growth is also against the TikTok ban.\n\nTo be sure, Yass and the Club for Growth have over the years also donated to many members of Congress who support banning TikTok, including Republican Senator Marco Rubio.\n\nPoker, Trading, and Schools\n\nThe son of two accountants and a math major himself, Yass went to Las Vegas after college and played poker professionally, Yass says in a video posted by Susquehanna on YouTube. He later moved to Philadelphia and worked as an options trader on the floor in 1981.\n\nA passion for betting and probability seems to permeate much of what he does.\n\n\"Sometimes I find myself at a race track literally trying to make $2 on an idea that I have,\" Yass, bespectacled and sitting in front of what appears to be a row of traders at their computers, said in the Susquehanna video.\n\nIn the political sphere, Yass is laser-focused on the issue of school choice programs, according to interviews with politicians who know him and fellow donors.\n\n\"He is truly a libertarian. His main interest is promoting school choice. That's what motivates Jeff,\" said Frayda Levin, a Republican donor who knows Yass and sees him at events at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank.\n\nLibertarians typically support maximizing individual rights and minimizing the role of government.\n\nIn addition to having poured millions into supporting school choice on a political level, Yass and his wife Janine Yass, with whom he has four children, award monetary prizes to education providers.\n\nSchool choice programs have gained wide appeal in recent years as some parents have become disgruntled with the state of U.S. public education, for reasons ranging from underfunding to concerns about what is taught in classrooms.\n\nHowever, some Democrats view the push to use state funds for private and religious schools with suspicion, saying they are attempts by Republicans to weaken public education while further enriching wealthy families.",

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) pressured Republicans to name the specific crime they are accusing President Biden of as they proceed with their impeachment inquiry.\n\nOcasio-Cortez noted the recent arrest of a former FBI informant for lying to the agency, fabricating the claim that Biden accepted a bribe while vice president to take actions to benefit the Ukrainian energy company his son served on the board of.\n\n\u201cAt this point, the story isn\u2019t the fact that the basis of this impeachment inquiry is wrong. The story is, \u2018Why it is proceeding anyway?\u2019\u201d she asked, saying Republicans have \u201cno charges.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have yet to hear in the chairman\u2019s opening the allegation that they are specifically charging the president of the United States with.

And that is the problem,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe story is, when this committee knew they were working with falsified evidence? That is the story.\u201d\n\nWednesday\u2019s hearing comes as a number of Republicans have become more openly critical of the probe, expressing doubt about whether it will lead to a formal impeachment trial.\n\nRepublicans invited two witnesses Wednesday with little connection to Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings.\n\nTop Stories from The Hill\n\nTony Bobulinski briefly worked with Hunter Biden, though the deal the two were working on never came to fruition. He later became aligned with allies of former President Trump, attending a presidential debate at his invitation. He is now represented by an attorney who represented numerous Trump White House aides before the Jan. 6 committee.\n\nJason Galanis, who is incarcerated on fraud charges brought in an indictment alongside Hunter Biden\u2019s former business partner, said he worked with the president\u2019s son, but that is in dispute; Hunter Biden said he only briefly met Galanis several years ago.\n\nBobulinski, in a heated exchange with Ocasio-Cortez, said he personally witnessed President Biden committing crimes, listing \u201ccorruption statues, RICO, and conspiracy, FARA\u201d in referencing racketeering laws and those that govern registering as a foreign agent.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear what activity Bobulinski would have witnessed that would qualify as a crime, and he has previously testified he had limited interactions with President Biden shortly after he left office.\n\nHe then added that the lawmaker was \u201cobviously not familiar with\u201d RICO.\n\n\u201cRICO is not a crime; it is a category; what is the crime,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez retorted.\n\nBobulinski grumbled about having to cite an exact statute and noted there are numerous lawyers on the committee.\n\nFederal RICO law, short for Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations, targets organized criminal activity and can be used to address a number of different crimes.\n\nIn addition to the federal law, several states have their own racketeering laws, including Georgia, where officials used the statute to charge former President Trump and other co-defendants in connection with Jan. 6.\n\nStory updated at 8:53 p.m.\n\nRead original article here",

Instead, his former business partners will testify about the extent of now-President Joe Biden\u2019s involvement in Hunter\u2019s business affairs.\n\nThe hearing is titled: \u201cInfluence Peddling: Examing Joe Biden\u2019s Abuse of Public Office.\u201d\n\nAnd dodging it is just Hunter\u2019s latest dodge of responsibility.\n\nFrom skipping out on his first deposition to hold a pity party of a press conference on the Capitol steps (just out of reach of the House sergeant at arms), to using his personal failings as a sob story to garner sympathy with the establishment media, he\u2019s done almost everything short of owning up to his failings and admitting guilt.\n\nIncluding just getting up and walking out when someone he doesn\u2019t like starts questioning him.\n\nToo bad us normies can\u2019t do that when fielding uncomfortable questions during a trial.\n\nDo you believe Hunter Biden is corrupt?

But as Greene shared with the good folks on the social media platform X, Hunter Biden decided, that instead of letting her ask a single question, he was just going to up and leave.\n\nHunter Biden is afraid to face me at the Oversight Committee hearing tomorrow.

Because he can\u2019t even face my words as I was about to speak to him. What a coward.\u201d\n\nWhat a coward indeed.\n\nOf course, anyone who\u2019s been following Joe Biden\u2019s disaster of a younger son knew that already.\n\nAfter all, this is a man too afraid to even acknowledge his own illegitimate daughter until forced to by the courts.\n\nEven so, witnessing such a stark example of his blatant cowardice is disturbing. And even after two months, the scene in the oversight committee hearing is shocking.\n\nNow, Marjorie Taylor Greene is a bit infamous among conservative and liberal circles alike for running her mouth and making herself obnoxious, publicly saying uncomfortable things most politicians would rather remain cloaked in euphemisms and gentle language.\n\nHowever, sometimes her blunt, uncompromising style is just what the doctor ordered for the D.C. swamp.\n\nThe Biden administration has become notorious for a lack of transparency, especially regarding the younger Biden\u2019s controversial business decisions.\n\nIn this instance, Greene is absolutely right to call him out for his cowardice.\n\nAs one X user wrote: \u201cLike all in the Degenerate Party, the law doesn\u2019t apply to them \u2014 nothing will happen.\u201d\n\nLike all in the Degenerate Party, the law doesn\u2019t apply to them \u2014 nothing will happen. https://t.co/DCscB2VfYw \u2014 JW (@jtw372) March 19, 2024\n\nGranted, her abrasive personality ensured her comments and retweets were incredibly divided, but in this case, you can\u2019t argue that this makes Hunter Biden look pretty bad.\n\nAnother user shared an interesting insight, commenting \u201cthis is how someone with something to hide acts.\u201d\n\nthis is how someone with something to hide acts. https://t.co/H0yyLY0JNs \u2014 Mini Ghost\u2122 (@ghostofdark) March 19, 2024\n\nHunter Biden has an entire legion of skeletons in his closet.\n\nAnd we need more people like Greene to call him out on his cowardly evasions and escapes.\n\nHe might be the son of the president, but he can\u2019t run forever.\n\nThis article appeared originally on The Western Journal.\n\nSubmit a Correction \u2192 * Name\n\n* Email\n\n* Message\n\n\n\n* All fields are required.

The Biden administration has been irked by Ukraine\u2019s strikes on Russian refineries because it threatens to upset the global oil economy, and has warned Kyiv against conducting further attacks on these targets, three individuals with knowledge on the matter told the FT.\n\nThe Biden administration sent these warnings to the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), which is Kyiv\u2019s state security network, and the Defence Intelligence of Ukraine (GUR), both of which have ramped up attacks on Russian targets by land and sea since the war began, the individuals told the FT.\n\nNEW | The Russian military continues to undertake structural reforms to simultaneously support the war in Ukraine while expanding Russia\u2019s conventional capabilities in the long term in preparation for a potential future large-scale conflict with NATO. pic.twitter.com/RLB8X96Z0p \u2014 Critical Threats (@criticalthreats) March 20, 2024\n\nThe Biden administration is concerned over Ukraine\u2019s attacks on Russian refineries because Russia has one of the largest oil industries in the world, despite crippling sanctions from the U.S. and international partners, according to the FT. There is also concern that if Ukraine continues attacks against these targets, Moscow will retaliate and hit energy networks that Western nations depend on, including the CPC oil pipeline from Kazakhstan to Russia that are used by Chevron and ExxonMobil.\n\nThe threat of heightened oil prices because of Ukraine\u2019s attacks against Russia\u2019s energy sector comes alongside U.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s reelection campaign this year.\n\n\u201cNothing terrifies a sitting American president more than a surge in pump prices during an election year,\u201d Bob McNally, former White House energy adviser and president of Rapidan Energy, told the FT.\n\nPublicly, the Biden administration has been supportive of Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive against Russia. Over $73 billion in U.S. aid has been delivered to Ukraine since the war began, and the Biden administration is urging Congress to pass an additional $60 billion aid package.\n\nPrivately, the Biden administration has looked at options for negotiations to end the war between Ukraine and Russia, according to Politico. Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive against Russia has largely stalled out amid a shortage of manpower and munitions, and Moscow\u2019s military-industrial complex is at full capacity.\n\nThe White House National Security Council, CIA, SBU and GUR did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Right: President Joe Biden speaks in Milwaukee, Wis., August 15, 2023.\n\nHouse Oversight Committee chairman James Comer (R., Ky.) will soon be inviting President Joe Biden to testify about his family\u2019s business dealings for the House GOP\u2019s impeachment inquiry.\n\nTwo of Hunter Biden\u2019s former business partners, Tony Bobulinski and Jason Galanis, testified on Wednesday to discuss the president\u2019s alleged role in his son\u2019s foreign business enterprise. At the end of the hearing Comer announced his plans to invite President Biden to testify himself.\n\n\u201cIn the coming days, I will invite President Biden to the House Oversight Committee to provide his testimony and explain why his family received tens of millions of dollars from foreign companies with his assistance,\u201d Comer announced. He did not specify whether he would issue a subpoena to the White House to compel testimony from Joe Biden.\n\nWhite House spokesman Ian Sams mocked Comer\u2019s announcement as a \u201cstunt\u201d and dismissed the impeachment inquiry.\n\nHunter Biden did not attend the hearing on Wednesday after previously having demanded that House Republicans allow him to testify publicly. His attorney, Abbe Lowell, told Comer last week that his client would not appear for the public hearing because it was designed to be a media circus. Devon Archer, a former Biden business partner and key witness in the impeachment inquiry, also declined to show up for the public hearing.\n\nIn closed-door testimony last month, Hunter Biden confirmed that his father met foreign business partners and spoke to business associates on speakerphone, corroborating significant portions of Archer\u2019s and Bobulinski\u2019s testimony. Nonetheless, he repeatedly insisted that Joe Biden played no role in his business dealings.\n\nJoe Biden himself has repeatedly denied having had any involvement with Hunter Biden\u2019s overseas dealings. The White House has disparaged and dismissed the impeachment inquiry on numerous occasions.\n\nThe extent of Joe Biden\u2019s involvement in his son\u2019s business enterprise during and after his vice presidency is the focus of the House GOP\u2019s impeachment inquiry into President Biden. Evidence gathered by the impeachment inquiry includes bank records, witness testimony, texts, emails, images, and other documents relevant to the investigation. Republican investigators have scrutinized Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings with individuals and entities in Ukraine, China, Russia, Romania, and Kazakhstan.\n\nAt the hearing, Bobulinski suggested that Joe Biden committed various crimes by assisting his son with his business dealings and voiced his support for impeaching the president. Most Notably, Bobulinski accused Hunter Biden and his uncle Jim of lying under oath about their business dealings with Chinese conglomerate CEFC.\n\nSimilarly, Galanis claimed that Hunter Biden had used his father to help close lucrative business deals and mentioned how Hunter leveraged the \u201cBiden lift,\u201d a term used by Galanis to describe access to Joe Biden.\n\nSpecial counsel David Weiss is prosecuting Hunter Biden for alleged federal gun and tax crimes committed in Delaware and California. Lowell claimed that Hunter Biden\u2019s court date in California on Thursday conflicted with the timing of the hearing.\n\nMore on National Review\n\nNews Related",

            "text": "Republican opposition continued to grow Tuesday against a $118 billion bipartisan border deal and foreign aid package ahead of a key vote in the Senate.\n\nThe bill is now on track to fail, as GOP infighting threatens to steamroll any congressional response to the border as well put aid to Ukraine and Israel in jeopardy.\n\nDespite containing policy aimed at toughening border restrictions pushed for by conservatives, the deal has faced relentless attacks from former President Donald Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican who has said the bill would be dead on arrival in his chamber - if it ever makes it out of the Senate. Trump, who is hoping to make immigration a key plank of his presidential campaign, has suggested on Truth Social that approving additional resources for the border would make Republicans \u201clook bad.\u201d\n\nOffering a blunt assessment of the grim prospects facing the bill, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters that the deal \u201cwill not become law,\u201d due to Johnson\u2019s opposition and concerns within the Senate GOP conference.\n\n\u201cWe had a very robust discussion about whether or not this product could ever become law, and it\u2019s been made pretty clear to us by the speaker that it will not become law,\u201d he said.\n\nTwo high-ranking members of Senate GOP leadership \u2013 John Thune, the No. 2 Senate Republican, and John Barrasso, the No. 3 Senate Republican \u2013 announced that they will vote against the measure in an initial procedural vote on Wednesday, the latest blow to a deal that was negotiated by Republican Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma, one of the most conservative senators, along with Independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut.\n\nA majority of Senate Republicans are now either actively planning to vote \u201cno\u201d during the first procedural vote on the package Wednesday or leaning against the bill. Many Republicans have attacked the policy directly, and some have argued there should be more time to consider, debate and amend the bill after it was released on Sunday evening.\n\nThune, the Senate GOP whip, said that he plans to vote against proceeding to the bill on Wednesday and said that blocking the package will be the \u201cpredominate position\u201d of GOP senators. Later in the day, Thune said, \u201cI would expect that the motion to proceed to the bill will fail.\u201d\n\nBarrasso, the chairman of the Senate GOP Conference, said in a statement, \u201cI cannot vote for this bill. Americans will turn to the upcoming election to end the border crisis.\u201d\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer harshly criticized Senate Republicans on Tuesday for deciding to oppose the package as it is currently written, accusing them of acting on Trump\u2019s marching orders.\n\n\u201cWe all know what\u2019s going on here. Donald Trump would rather keep the chaos at the border so he can exploit it on the campaign trail, instead of letting the Senate do the right thing and fix it. He would rather let Ukraine suffer on the battlefield, instead of being tough on Putin,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cAnd instead of standing up to Donald Trump, Senate Republicans are ready to kill our best chance at fixing the border and ready to vote down this aid package for Ukraine in order to put what they think \u2013 they think \u2013 is their party\u2019s political interest above the interests of the country.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic leader also went after Republican demands for more time to read the bill, noting that they had requested 72 hours, and saying he would offer to move the first procedural vote to Thursday if they want another day. \u201cI suspect they won\u2019t accept even that offer, because they really don\u2019t want more time. They\u2019re just using it as an excuse,\u201d he said.\n\nSen. John Cornyn, another prominent senior Republican, said he plans to vote no on moving forward with the deal, adding that he wants to see changes to parts of the bill.\n\n\u201cWe need more time,\u201d Cornyn told CNN, adding later: \u201cI\u2019m a \u2018no\u2019 on the motion to proceed.\u201d\n\nMurphy, a key Democratic border deal negotiator, blasted Senate Republicans on Tuesday, calling them a \u201cdisaster\u201d and describing their treatment of Lankford, the top GOP negotiator, as \u201cdisgusting,\u201d saying he never expected they would leave him \u201changing out to dry as badly as they did.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never expected they would leave Senator Lankford hanging out to dry as badly as they did,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cI thought they would be able to find the votes to support a very tough, conservative compromise that he was able to win.\u201d\n\nLankford said on Tuesday that he has been \u201cdisappointed\u201d in his colleagues who he says are mischaracterizing the package in order to reject it, rather than what is actually in the bill.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the part that\u2019s disappointing to me, is to say if you\u2019re going to disagree with it, disagree with it based on the facts of the bill, not something that\u2019s actually factually not true,\u201d he said, pointing to accusations that the package includes amnesty, allows thousands more migrants to enter the US, and incentivizes more people to cross the border.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised at the misinformation that\u2019s out there, and how effective that has been,\u201d added Lankford.\n\nHe acknowledged that \u201cit\u2019s not looking good\u201d for the package to eventually become law, as more GOP senators demand more time to consider the language or reject it outright.\n\nOn Tuesday, McConnell said, \u201cI want to congratulate Senator Lankford on a remarkable job of negotiating with the other side, getting the support of the border council, but it looks to me and to most of our members is that we have no real chance here to make a law.\u201d\n\nWhile Trump and other Republicans have attacked the bill as too weak, it would mark a tough change to immigration law and would give the president far-reaching powers to restrict illegal migrant crossings at the southern border.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal editorial board called the deal \u201cthe most restrictive migrant legislation in decades,\u201d saying \u201cits provisions include long-time GOP priorities\u201d in an op-ed titled \u201cA Border Security Bill Worth Passing.\u201d\n\nThe sweeping legislative package would also provide aid to key US allies abroad, including billions of dollars to support Ukraine in its fight against Russia and security assistance for Israel, as well as humanitarian assistance for civilians in Gaza, the West Bank and Ukraine.\n\nIt is unclear if Congress will be able to pass aid to Ukraine and Israel separate from border measures as many Republican senators had previously demanded that the issues be paired together.\n\nAsked if Congress should drop the border elements of the package and pass the rest of the security supplemental for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, Cornyn indicated he supported that approach.\n\n\u201cI would say defer the border and do the rest,\u201d he said.\n\nJohnson is pushing to pass a stand-alone Israel aid package on Tuesday, but that is also on the brink of collapse amid opposition from far-right Republicans and Democratic leaders, according to multiple GOP sources.\n\nPresident Joe Biden would veto a House standalone aid package for Israel, the White House said Monday.\n\n\u201cThe Administration spent months working with a bipartisan group of Senators to reach a national security agreement that secures the border and provides support for the people of Ukraine and Israel, while also providing much-needed humanitarian assistance to civilians affected by conflicts around the world,\u201d the White House wrote in a statement. \u201cInstead of working in good faith to address the most pressing national security challenges, this bill is another cynical political maneuver.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.",

The president has said he had no involvement with Hunter\u2019s business dealings and the White House has described the GOP\u2019s impeachment effort as \u201csad, pathetic and a waste of everyone\u2019s time.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday during a hearing in Biden\u2019s impeachment inquiry, Ocasio-Cortez engaged in a tense exchange with Tony Bobulinski, a former associate of the president\u2019s son Hunter and a witness whose testimony she said did not satisfy Republicans\u2019 accusations of high crimes by the president.\n\nDuring the exchange, Ocasio-Cortez asked Bobulinski to specifically name crimes he witnessed Biden commit, \u201cIs it your testimony today that you personally witnessed President Joe Biden commit a crime?\u201d\n\nIn response, Bobulinksi said, \u201cYes\u2026You asked me to answer the question, I answered the question, RICO, you\u2019re obviously not familiar with, corruption.\u201d\n\nHowever, before Bobulinksi could continue, Ocasio-Cortez interjected by stating, \u201cExcuse me, sir, RICO is not a crime, it is a category. What is the crime?\u201d\n\nNewsweek has reached out to Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s office via email for comment.\n\nSince Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s comments, some have taken to X, formerly Twitter, to point out Trump\u2019s RICO charges in Georgia.\n\nTrump and 18 co-defendants were indicted by a Georgia grand jury in August and face criminal racketeering charges for allegedly attempting to overturn the state\u2019s electoral results in the 2020 election won by Biden. Trump, the presumptive 2024 Republican presidential nominee, has pleaded not guilty to all 13 charges against him and has repeatedly said the case is part of a political witch hunt.\n\nNewsweek has reached out to Trump\u2019s spokesperson via email for comment.\n\nPolitical commentator Sara Gonzales wrote on X, \u201cWell damn. Hope @AOC can tell Fani Willis to drop those RICO charges against Trump.\u201d\n\nPodcast host Matt Locke said on X, \u201cWhat an imbecile @AOC is. Corruption is a crime. They are charging Donald Trump with RICO or racketeering. That is a crime.\u201d\n\nWhile X user Travis wrote on X, \u201cSomeone tell Fani Willis to drop all charges because AOC says RICO is not a crime.\u201d\n\nHowever, during the hearing, Ocasio-Cortez continued to explain that House Republicans have failed to accuse Biden of a \u201chigh crime,\u201d which is a requirement for impeachment.\n\n\u201cAt this point, the story is not the fact that the basis of this impeachment inquiry is wrong. The story is why it\u2019s proceeding anyway. Why is this committee proceeding based on false charges?\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said.\n\nFulton County District Attorney Fani Willis has led the investigation, however, the case remains at a standstill as an appeal into disqualifying Willis in the case will make it its way to the the Georgia Court of Appeals to determine if they will take it up. This follows accusations by former Trump staffer and co-defendant Michael Roman that she was in a relationship with Nathan Wade, a special prosecutor she hired in the high-profile case, and that the pair benefited from taxpayer money.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nStart your unlimited Newsweek trial\n\nNews Related",

The candidates have set the stage for a historic rematch in the general election in November, despite their low popularity ratings.\n\nAs The Economist writes, according to averaged polling data, 45% of voters are ready to support Biden, and 44% - Trump. Overall, as of March, the chances of both candidates look roughly equal.",

DeSantis signed bill that prevents homeless camping in public spaces 02:28\n\nMIAMI BEACH - Florida's homeless will be banned from sleeping on sidewalks and in parks and other public spaces under a law signed Wednesday by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. It also promises the homeless greater access to services for issues such as substance abuse and mental health problems.\n\nThe state Department of Children and Families would oversee local governments that set up designated areas for the homeless to camp for up to a year under the new law, which takes effect Oct. 1. Anyone using those encampments would be prohibited from using alcohol or illegal drugs, with sanitation and security to be provided.\n\nThe encampments would be created if local homeless shelters reach maximum capacity. The law requires regional entities to provide necessary behavioral treatment access as a condition of a county or city creating an encampment.\n\nAllowing the homeless to camp in public spaces affects the local quality of life, can be a nuisance for businesses and makes it more difficult to deliver them needed services because they're scattered, DeSantis and other supporters of the measure said at a news conference in Miami Beach.\n\n\"I think this is absolutely the right balance to strike,\" DeSantis said. \"We want to make sure we put public safety above all else.\"\n\nMiami Beach passed a similar resolution back in October of last year. Miami Beach Mayor Stephen Meiner called the ordinance passionate legislation.\n\n\"It helps people. It's increasing funding for shelters. It's increasing funding for mental health treatment. It's increasing funding for substance abuse treatment. This will absolutely help people,\" he said.\n\nRon Book with the Miami-Dade County Homeless Trust said the county has done a good job of managing the homeless population.\n\n\"The numbers of individuals experiencing homelessness all across America are going up, except in Miami-Dade County, where we continue to manage the population, moving people in and off the street in an expeditious fashion,\" he said.\n\nBook said the legislation needs to go one step further.\n\n\"This is but one piece to the puzzle. Hopefully, shortly, the governor will also sign the changes that were made to the Baker Act that begin to address behavioral health issues that we know we have with homeless individuals in our state,\" he said.\n\nDuring the Legislature's latest session, Florida's homeless population was estimated to be about 30,700 in 2023. That's a fraction of the homeless populations in many large U.S. cities, but the law's sponsors said it could worsen because of Florida's rapid population growth.\n\n\"This bill will not eliminate homelessness. But it is a start,\" said Republican state Rep. Sam Garrison. \"And it states clearly that in Florida, our public spaces are worth fighting for.\"\n\nOpponents of the law say it is meant to round up the homeless and hide them from public view.\n\n\"This bill does not and it will not address the more pressing and root cause of homelessness,\" said Democratic state Sen. Shevrin Jones during a debate this year. \"We are literally reshuffling the visibility of unhoused individuals with no exit strategy for people who are experiencing homelessness.\"\n\nDeSantis, however, said the new law is a unique approach in pledging to provide the services that homeless people often need.\n\n\"This is going to require that the services are there to help people get back on their feet,\" the governor said. \"I think it's important that we maintain the quality of life for the citizens of Florida.\"\n\nBeginning in January 2025, the law will allow residents, local business owners and the state attorney general to file a lawsuit to stop any city or county from allowing the homeless to camp or sleep on public property.",

However, if former President Trump regains the presidency, he will likely reverse these advancements or work with a Republican-led Congress to dismantle the law.\n\nThe IRA encompasses a range of measures, including tax credits for environmentally friendly energy sources and electric vehicles, funding for grants supporting climate-conscious projects, and penalties for oil and gas companies contributing to methane leaks.\n\nSince its enactment, Republicans have targeted the IRA, and if they secure control of the White House and Congress in the upcoming election, they are expected to push for at least partial repeal.\n\nEven if Republicans win the presidency but lack control of both houses of Congress or need time to strategize a repeal, a second Trump administration could utilize executive actions to undermine the IRA.\n\nSome conservatives are advocating for such actions, suggesting a focus on minimizing taxpayer expenses and preventing financial support from flowing to entities like the Chinese Communist Party. Critical mechanisms for altering IRA programs could involve revising tax credit guidance issued by the Treasury Department.\n\nThe Biden administration has broadly interpreted these credits, expanding eligibility, especially concerning electric vehicles. Critics argue that these subsidies benefit foreign manufacturers and inflate costs for American consumers.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign has vowed to repeal what it deems radical mandates, particularly those related to electric vehicles. They claim these mandates are detrimental to the American auto industry and a boon to China.\n\nSome conservatives argue that tax credit policies could be scaled back through new Treasury interpretations without necessitating changes to the law itself.\n\nHowever, the Treasury has defended its interpretations, which align with congressional intent and existing tax law. Despite possible challenges, conservatives remain determined to oppose IRA programs they view as excessive government intervention.\n\nCongressional efforts to dismantle the IRA have faced resistance, with specific provisions garnering support from within the Republican Party.\n\nWhile total repeal may be unlikely, essential modifications could be pursued. Nevertheless, restricting popular tax credits may invite political backlash.\n\nThe fate of the IRA hangs in the balance, with Democrats championing its climate-friendly provisions and Republicans seeking to roll back what they perceive as government overreach. The outcome of future elections will shape the trajectory of climate policy in the United States.",

However, the report only covers a part of the committees associated with those running for office.\n\nWATCH | US Elections 2024: Nikki Haley backer Harry Sloan to donate to Biden Biden at the end of February, had $71 million in cash available in his main campaign account which is more than double of Trump\u2019s $33.5 million.\n\nThe filings show that the former president received more than $3 million in his campaign account in February, which added to the $30 million on hand in January.\n\nHowever, the incumbent president, which had $56 million by the end of January, added $15 million in February.\n\nWhile Trump is in the lead in more nationwide polls, Biden and the Democratic Party have a growing cash advantage.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee, according to the filing, had more than twice the cash on hand when compared to its Republican counterpart.\n\nHowever, the report does not show the entire picture since Biden and Trump are raising money through joint fundraising committees which will not file their reports until the end of next month.\n\nA Trump campaign official told CNN that their campaign and joint fundraising committee brought in $20.3 million in February and they entered this month with a combined $41.9 million cash.\n\nThe amount still trails behind Biden\u2019s campaign which reported raising a combined $53 million in February across the committees supporting his re-election bid, with a combined total of a whopping $155 million.\n\nReasons behind the cash gap\n\nBiden, as the current president, reportedly has an advantage over Trump, who became the presumptive Republican nominee only in February.\n\nThe cash crunch has also reportedly prompted the former president to have meetings at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida and even host private dinners with the Republican Party\u2019s biggest financiers.\n\nThe former president\u2019s lagging in terms of cash could also be attributed to his many legal woes as the filings also show the financial strain it is taking on his campaign. Trump is currently facing four criminal trials.\n\nAlso Read | Trump Tower among properties that could be seized to cover $454mn civil fraud fine\n\nThe financial disclosures of the group called Save America \u2013 which raises money together with Trump\u2019s election campaign but is legally separate and reportedly used to underwrite his lawyers\u2019 fees \u2013 showed that around $5.6 million was spent on legal bills in February.\n\nThe amount spent was the biggest single month of spending on legal bills since Trump formed the organisation in 2020 after his election defeat four years ago.\n\nThe filings also show that the group has spent more than $55 million on legal bills since the beginning of last year.",

            "text": "Experts hate to be wrong. When I first started writing about the public\u2019s hostility toward expertise and established knowledge more than a decade ago, I predicted that any number of crises\u2014including a pandemic\u2014might be the moment that snaps the public back to its senses. I was wrong. I didn\u2019t foresee how some citizens and their leaders would respond to the cycle of advances and setbacks in the scientific process and to the inevitable limitations of human experts.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic, in particular, would prove the perfect crucible for accelerating the decline of faith in experts. Paranoia and appeals to ignorance have long been part of the American political environment, but they were especially destructive at a time when the U.S. was riven by partisan hostility. The pandemic struck at multiple political and cultural weaknesses within the edifice of American life: A mysterious disease\u2014from China, no less, a nation that typically serves as a source of American anxiety\u2014forced citizens to rely on the media, including outlets that many of them already distrusted, for scattered pieces of information from white-jacketed experts and relatively unknown government officials.\n\nMany elected leaders, especially at the national level, failed in fact to lead. The dysfunction of President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, on COVID-19 and on so many other issues, has been amply documented in numerous books and articles. Despite the undeniable success of Operation Warp Speed, the government\u2019s crash program to work with private industry to develop a vaccine in record time, Trump and his people have much to answer for\u2014including the hesitancy they engendered among Americans to take the very vaccines that his administration helped develop.\n\nThe road to America\u2019s pandemic meltdown, however, did not begin with Trump. When the coronavirus arrived, a significant number of Americans were already primed by the media, their political leaders, and their own stubborn narcissism to reject expert advice during a crisis. The collapse of gatekeeping authority in the media, the explosion of worthless online sources, the emergence of celebrity pseudo-experts, and the unwarranted self-confidence of millions of people who believed that they could simply \u201cdo their own research,\u201d as the internet mantra has it, all combined to make a brutal outbreak of disease even more deadly.\n\nRead: The coronavirus-denial movement now has a leader\n\nNevertheless, where the death of expertise is concerned, the scientific community and its allies in the public-policy arena made two fundamental mistakes early on. One is that they tried to take the place of elected officials: They issued guidance and policy instructions while trying to fill the vacuum left by poor leadership in Washington, D.C., and other regions of the United States. And at the height of the lockdowns, doctors and local authorities in some cities made a nakedly political calculation about whether and when their ostensibly firm pandemic restrictions could be ignored.\n\nMasks and lockdowns were among the most divisive pandemic measures. As usual, Trump was resolutely ignorant and self-centered. He and his movement coalesced around depicting such public-health measures as symbols of government autocracy. At a July 2020 White House meeting, Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, advised him to advocate for mask mandates, which at that point even most Republicans supported. Trump\u2019s chief of staff, Mark Meadows, objected. \u201cWe can\u2019t do the masks,\u201d he told the president. \u201cThe base will just turn on you.\u201d Trump sided with Meadows.\n\nBut many of Trump\u2019s opponents themselves adopted a blinkered insistence on such mandates as their own version of political signaling. In an already polarized environment, each side hoisted their flags and charged into battle\u2014with scant regard for evidence or expert advice.\n\nThe scientists unwisely stepped into this mess, with predictable results. The American public has little tolerance for nuance or complexity, and the recommendations on mask wearing were difficult to parse and changed over time. What kind of mask would work best? (An N-95 respirator\u2014if worn correctly.) Would cloth masks work? Bandannas, maybe? (Probably not very well.) Should masks be worn everywhere? Indoors, outdoors\u2014even at home?\n\nThe public wanted clear and unambiguous answers that the scientists could not give them: yes or no, safe or unsafe, on or off. Woefully unaccustomed to explaining complicated issues to ordinary citizens, they made a hash of the messaging and simply tried to push for masks as a generic measure, until many Americans\u2014even those who wanted to be cooperative\u2014gave up.\n\nAdvocates for lockdowns and strict masking rules argued that they had the stronger point in a time of uncertainty. Such prophylactic measures, they contended, even if ragged and inconsistent, were better than flatly ignoring manifest public-health dangers. But \u201cfollowing the science\u201d means following all of the science, and these rigid, dogmatic responses downplayed the fact that the science was also showing that some COVID-19 policies did, in fact, carry a destructive price. The lockdowns, as the COVID Crisis Group (a nonpartisan collection of scholars and scientists) noted later, were not a solution but a \u201csledgehammer\u201d that took the place of better preparation and resulted from an inability to agree on almost anything else.\n\nThe subsequent extended closure of public spaces in the U.S. produced deep social and economic wounds, but the controversy over when to reopen schools was a particularly important area of expert failure. The closures of educational institutions went on too long in many parts of the country, resulting in emotional and intellectual damage to American students.\n\nRead: Paging Dr. Hamblin: Why didn\u2019t America\u2019s shutdowns work?\n\nMany progressives, however, bitterly contested growing evidence both that in-person schooling was relatively safe and that school closures had created catastrophic learning loss. This was in many cases a stubborn reaction, a kind of polar opposition to the obdurate people on the right who dismissed almost all pandemic measures as oppression. For the left, as the New York magazine columnist Jonathan Chait later noted, \u201cthe evidence did eventually win out,\u201d while the Republicans descended into an \u201cepistemic disaster\u201d that persists to this day.\n\nUnfortunately, the evidence did not win out in time to prevent harm, especially in schools. Public-school parents wanted their children to be back in the classroom, but many teachers were hesitant, and one of their largest unions, the American Federation of Teachers, and its leader, Randi Weingarten, were resistant to the point of militancy. Weingarten warned in July 2020 that the AFT might even support strikes if teachers were forced back to the classroom.\n\nThe pressure from the AFT had a clear effect on national policy subsequently. Within weeks of taking office in 2021, President Joe Biden backpedaled on his campaign promises to open schools. According to my Atlantic colleague Franklin Foer, Biden acquiesced to writing off the rest of the academic year as \u201cthe price of peace\u201d with the union.\n\nThe teachers\u2019 concerns were understandable, but the intransigence of some of their union leaders did significant harm to their already battered standing. Meanwhile, over those same months, another expert community\u2014this time, medical professionals\u2014needlessly inflicted a grievous wound on the impartiality of their own expertise.\n\nOn May 25, 2020, a white police officer murdered a Black man named George Floyd during an arrest in Minneapolis. The incident was captured on video and protests soon broke out all over America.\n\nDoctors and scientists had a problem on their hands. Floyd\u2019s killing produced an outpouring of grief and anger: Americans wanted to gather, they wanted to support one another, they wanted to vent their fury, and they wanted to shout their demands for justice into the face of their government. And yet because of COVID-19 restrictions, most Americans could not congregate in public. They could not go to church or sing in a choir. They could not celebrate their marriages, bury their dead, or even, in some areas, meet outdoors for a picnic. Schoolchildren were still trapped in their home.\n\nAmerica\u2019s cities were beginning to boil, and public-safety officials faced a no-win situation: If states and localities tried to suppress the demonstrations, their directions would be ignored. But if they allowed the protests, they were admitting that the pandemic restrictions were capricious rules that could bend in the political wind. How could one cause be important enough to allow thousands upon thousands of people to gather in close proximity, while all other citizens were told that their rights\u2014including their freedom to worship and to engage in peaceful assembly\u2014were secondary to the needs of public health and that they must stay home?\n\nRead: Facing a COVID-19 resurgence and unable to act\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci was at the time the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and one of the the U.S. government\u2019s main public-health spokespeople. He would later enter right-wing demonology caricatured as a leftist authoritarian, but in June 2020 he gave one of the most diplomatic and sensible answers to be found among the scientists:\n\nIt\u2019s a difficult situation. We have the right to peacefully demonstrate and the demonstrators are exercising that right \u2026 It\u2019s a delicate balance because the reasons for demonstrating are valid and yet the demonstration itself puts oneself at an additional risk. The only thing we can do as public-health officials is to keep warning people to be careful. And if you are going to go out, please make sure you wear a mask and you keep the mask on at all times.\n\nOther doctors, however, were eager to show solidarity with the protests. In June 2020, more than 1,200 medical professionals signed an open letter supporting the demonstrations, casting Floyd\u2019s death as a health menace on the same level as the pandemic. \u201cInfectious disease and public health narratives adjacent to demonstrations against racism must be consciously anti-racist, and infectious disease experts must be clear and consistent in prioritizing an anti-racist message,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWhite supremacy is a lethal public health issue that predates and contributes to COVID-19.\u201d\n\nNoble if stilted rhetoric, but even people who empathized with the protesters had to notice that the previous strict prohibitions on gathering were now, for the sake of an important political cause, apparently negotiable. According to The Washington Post, Ranu S. Dhillon, an infectious-disease expert at Harvard Medical School, characterized the protests as risky but necessary\u2014just like working in a nursing home or grocery store, an approach that showed how out of touch many professionals were with ordinary people who were afraid to visit elderly relatives or go to the market.\n\nThe available evidence does not so far suggest that the protests created a major surge in COVID-19 infections. But to argue that the sudden reversal in public-health advice did not result in more infections is a post hoc rationalization\u2014and, for experts, a trap.\n\nAt the time, the medical guidance was clear that people should not gather in large groups or be in proximity, and certainly not while singing and shouting. If doctors believed that the risks of such gatherings could be mitigated with masks or by being outdoors, they should have already been pressing for the lifting of the strictest measures everywhere, with the same advice they gave protesters. But if they were still holding to the theories that underpinned the lockdowns\u2014and especially the school closures\u2014then their approval of the demonstrations meant they were consciously setting aside those concerns in the name of a political cause with which they agreed.\n\nEither way, they were acting as advocates rather than scientists. In the words of the environmental journalist Peter M. Sandman, they \u201cclearly damaged the credibility of public health as a scientific enterprise that struggles to be politically neutral.\u201d\n\nThe global pandemic emergency is formally over, and the experts are still assessing what they did right and wrong\u2014as they should. But in the U.S., the political damage from the coronavirus wars remains. The most intrusive measures, including lockdowns and masking, are long gone. For most Americans, especially the elderly and other vulnerable groups, avoiding the most serious consequences of COVID-19 has become chiefly a matter of getting vaccinated and staying current on booster shots, as they would with flu and pneumonia.\n\nAnd yet, the U.S. still lags the rest of the developed world in protection against COVID-19. According to the CDC\u2019s most up-to-date data, from 2023, some 70 percent of Americans received an initial vaccination, but fewer than 20 percent have had any booster. The rates are much better among people over 65, who\u2014for various reasons, including their awareness of the disease\u2019s increased danger for their age group\u2014are more attentive to getting vaccinated.\n\nThe ultimate numbers, however, obscure the deep political divisions over vaccination, preventive measures, and science itself. A New York Times/Siena poll in 2023 found that nearly 70 percent of likely Republican voters would trust \u201cthe common sense of ordinary people\u201d over \u201cthe knowledge of trained experts.\u201d (In a Pew poll a year earlier, 51 percent of Americans said that public-health officials had done an excellent or good job at managing the pandemic, but that number was anchored by the 72 percent of Democrats who felt that way; only 29 percent of Republicans agreed.)\n\nTrump, of course, has continued his crude deployment of ignorance and fear in his second bid to regain the American presidency. When new variants of the virus began to spread in the summer of 2023, Trump released a video decrying the \u201ctyrants\u201d who were going to impose new pandemic mandates. \u201cWe will not comply,\u201d he said, defying measures that did not actually exist. Fortunately, most people in the United States now have some level of immunity, and governments at all levels have learned a great deal about monitoring and treating the disease.\n\nNonetheless, as the COVID Crisis Group noted in 2023, \u201cone key predictor of infections and total COVID deaths\u201d in each state during the pandemic \u201cwas the share of people that voted for President Trump in the 2020 presidential election.\u201d Or, as a member of the group remarked in an overview of the pandemic\u2019s course and the American lives lost, \u201cTrump was a comorbidity.\u201d\n\nJay Varma: The public-health calculus has shifted\n\nThe experts failed at some important points, especially in the early days of the pandemic, but much of what the public believed to be failure was better described as science\u2014the way that knowledge itself is developed as experts worked through a new problem with limited data. They argued and tested competing explanations and solutions. Such debates and discussions, along with the inevitable costs of trial and error during a time of emergency, are the normal processes of scientific investigation. But America\u2019s political environment in 2020, poisoned by ignorance and rigid tribalism, virtually guaranteed that almost all aspects of the pandemic response\u2014both failures and successes\u2014would become divisive and partisan issues.\n\nExperts are fallible human beings, and they will sometimes give poor advice or make mistakes. But an advanced society and its government cannot do without them, no matter what a significant number of Americans seem to believe. To ignore expert advice is simply not a realistic option: Policy making is complex, and citizens have some responsibility to stay informed about issues that directly affect their own well-being. Experts always need to remember that they are the servants, not the masters, of a democratic society and a republican government. But as James Madison presciently warned, if citizens are to be the authors of their own fate, they must first equip themselves with knowledge, and then practice the civic virtue based on reason and cooperation that makes an informed democracy possible.\n\nBefore the next crisis\u2014and there will always be another\u2014citizens, experts, and policy makers have to engage in a difficult debate about the role of experts and educated elites in American democracy. For now, such possibilities have been thwarted by the partisan combat that erupted after the coronavirus pandemic. I still have confidence that we can, at some point, embrace the reality-based understandings we once accepted as obvious: Chief among them is that although every single vote in a democracy is as equally valid as every other, every single opinion is not.\n\nAmerica needs to reestablish new rules for productive engagement between the educated elites and the society they serve. But after the political events and natural disasters of the past decade, the creation of a more productive relationship between the experts and the public is going to be a challenge, and it will require time. The sooner the better, because the clock, as always, is counting down to the next unknown disaster.\n\nThis essay is adapted from a new edition of the author\u2019s book The Death of Expertise: The Campaign Against Established Knowledge and Why It Matters .",

            "text": "Lady Gaga and Joaquin Phoenix singing show tunes, probably. Photo: James Devaney/GC Images\n\nJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux is a corporate rebrand. The first film was a decidedly straight male phenomenon with Scorsese\u2019s King of Comedy vibes and a full-on Oscar win for Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s portrayal of the titular deranged villain. Its upcoming sequel, on the other hand, treads down different steps. Folie \u00e0 Deux will be a musical fantasia starring pop icon Lady Gaga opposite Phoenix\u2019s Joker. (We can be certain, though, that the second movie is gunning for awards just like its predecessor.) Little is known about the actual plot of the film, aside from the fact that it chronicles the moment Harley Quinn and Arthur Fleck fall in love at Gotham City\u2019s Arkham Asylum. With filming wrapped, first looks dropped, and set footage circulating the internet, below is everything you need to know about director Todd Phillips\u2019s DC Universe superhero sing-along Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux.\n\nIs Joker 2 really going to be a musical \u2026 ?\n\nJoker (Jacques Demy\u2019s Version) Folie \u00e0 Deux will, in fact, be a musical. And it might have even more music than you expected. On March 22, Variety reported that the movie leans toward being \u201cmostly a jukebox musical\u201d \u2014 to the tune of at least 15 covers of \u201cvery well-known songs,\u201d including \u201cThat\u2019s Entertainment.\u201d Insiders said one or two original songs might also make the final soundtrack. Ominous reports of a musical sequel first emerged in August 2022, when an insider told Variety that the sequel has \u201ccomplicated musical sequences\u201d that are more in line with A Star Is Born than In the Heights.\n\nLeaked on-set footage appeared to confirm the threat of show tunes. The videos were taken in New York on March 31, 2023 and show Lady Gaga performing a rendition of \u201cA Couple of Swells,\u201d the Fred Astair and Judy Garland duet from the 1948 musical Easter Parade. Phoenix was not filmed singing, but it\u2019s only a matter of time before we see him doing jazz squares down the Joker steps.\n\nThe film\u2019s composer, Hildur Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir, thinks the musical route makes sense for Folie \u00e0 Deux. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting decision,\u201d she told Variety on January 15, 2023. \u201cI think it\u2019s somehow logical at the same time. It\u2019s both logical and also very surprising for me as well as the audience. So far, it\u2019s just been a really beautiful conversation, and I\u2019m really excited to see how it unfolds.\u201d Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir doesn\u2019t really dive into the \u201cwhy?\u201d of it all, but perhaps they didn\u2019t want to waste Gaga\u2019s classically trained voice or the opportunity to make a film even more inescapable than its predecessor.\n\nWhere are they filming Joker 2?\n\nFilming began in Los Angeles in December 2022. Beyond first looks released through the sequel\u2019s official social-media channels and Gaga\u2019s Twitter, we didn\u2019t get a taste of the actual locations until March, when diehards began to share every known filming location on the internet. Fans spotted Phoenix as Arthur Fleck and an unidentified actor also dressed as the Joker running through the streets of downtown L.A. The leading man wore a dusty-gray suit complete with smudged clown makeup and fake blood on his ear. His co-star (or body double, perhaps?) managed to keep his clown makeup pristine, though the same can\u2019t be said for his dirty red suit and yellow vest.\n\nAdditional filming locations leaked after the production went cross-country (i.e., to New York and New Jersey). Folie \u00e0 Deux filmed the Arkham Asylum scenes at the shuttered Essex County Isolation Hospital. Much of the film is said to be centered around the Joker and Harley Quinn\u2019s meeting at the asylum, making the New Jersey location pivotal. Additional scenes were filmed outside the same courthouse where Donald Trump was arraigned in New York City (lol) and the so-called Joker stairs in the Bronx. Production reportedly wrapped on April 4, 2023.\n\nWhy is Lady Gaga playing Harley Quinn over Margot Robbie?\n\nCreative freedom? Todd Phillips is a Little Monster? The delicious promise of a Lady Gaga press tour? Mostly, it\u2019s because Robbie\u2019s Quinn exists in the DCEU, led by Josh Safran and James Gunn, which doesn\u2019t include the Joker films or Matthew Reeves\u2019s The Batman. Either way, Robbie gave Gaga her blessing in October 2022. \u201cIt makes me so happy because I said from the very beginning that all I want is for Harley Quinn to be one of those characters \u2014 the way Macbeth or Batman always gets passed from great actor to great actor,\u201d she said in an interview with MTV News. \u201cSomeone gets to do their Batman, or someone gets to do their Macbeth.\u201d Ah, yes, the opportunity to play the timeless Shakespearean role that is Harley Quinn. We are seeing herstory in action, folks.\n\nAnd what does Gaga Quinn look like?\n\nIt\u2019s a fair question \u2014 over the course of her starring film roles (A Star Is Born, House of Gucci, now this), Gaga\u2019s acting has become increasingly mannered. With a comic-book musical about mental illness leading to cartoonish evil, she\u2019s got the Oscars vehicle to match. Whether or not she wins any awards for \u201cbest\u201d acting remains to be seen, but we feel confident that she can make a play for any awards that ask for \u201cmost\u201d acting. On Valentine\u2019s Day 2024, Phillips shared three pics from the film, which included Gaga with the widest eyes known to man alongside Phoenix in full glam, a pic of the two waltzing, and the most Gaga pic of all: the two actors with their noses pressed together. Yes, that does mean we\u2019re getting nose content in this film, even if the noses aren\u2019t commented on. We just wanna take another look at her. To quote a musical Gaga is not starring in: Thank goodness.\n\nWhat does \u201cfolie \u00e0 deux\u201d mean?\n\nIt\u2019s French for starring Lady Gaga a delusion or mental illness shared by two people. We\u2019re not going to spell it out, but the title makes sense considering what we know about the plot of the movie.\n\nWhen will Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux hit theaters?\n\nThe film bursts into song on October 4, 2024. The inevitable sing-along version has not yet received a release date.\n\nThis post has been updated.",

According to the complaint, the DOE\u2019s move earlier this year pausing major liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminal projects violated long-standing federal energy laws.\n\n\u201cBiden\u2019s unilateral decree disregards statutory mandates, flouts the legal process, upends the oil and gas industry, disrupts the Texas economy, and subverts our constitutional structure,\u201d said Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton.\n\n\u201cThe ban will drive billions of dollars in investment away from Texas, hinder our ability to maximize revenue for public schools, force Texas producers to flare excess natural gas instead of taking it to market, and annihilate critical jobs,\u201d he continued. \u201cI will not stand by while Biden attacks Texas.\u201d\n\nGOP LEADERS CONFRONT BIDEN\u2019S NEW CLIMATE CZAR ON KEY SECURITY RISKS LURKING IN GREEN AGENDA\n\nAccording to Paxton, the LNG export moratorium is unconstitutional, ignores the 1938 Natural Gas Act\u2019s \u201cpresumption in favor of exports\u201d and discards decades of DOE energy policy.\n\nIn arguing the alleged unconstitutionality of the policy, the states\u2019 complaint notes Article I of the Constitution vests Congress with \u201c[a]ll legislative Powers,\u201d including the power \u201c[t]o regulate Commerce with foreign Nations.\u201d Therefore, since blocking LNG exports can be considered a regulation of commerce, the DOE violated the Constitution, according to the lawsuit.\n\nTIKTOK ACTIVIST SAYS HE ADVISED WHITE HOUSE ON BIDEN\u2019S NEW NATURAL GAS MORATORIUM\n\n\u201cThe LNG Export Ban implicates an issue of profound national importance. LNG exports account for billions of dollars to the economy and thousands of jobs,\u201d the complaint states. \u201cThey also raise serious questions of national security. And this is an issue that has been the subject of proposed legislation and public attention in and outside of Congress.\u201d\n\nThe complaint accuses DOE of violating the Administrative Procedure Act which governs the procedures of administrative law. The states highlight that DOE failed to host any public comment period before finalizing its LNG policy without \u201cgood cause to forego the notice and comment requirement.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, the states argue the DOE failed to properly consider the Natural Gas Act and its provision that states the agency issue an export license before hearing from the public.\n\nDOZENS OF FORMER TOP FEDERAL OFFICIALS CALL ON CONGRESS TO STRIKE DOWN BIDEN\u2019S NATURAL GAS CRACKDOWN\n\n\u201cThe Biden administration\u2019s illegal attacks on American energy jeopardizes the livelihoods of thousands of hard-working Louisiana men and women, millions of dollars in tax revenue, and billions of dollars in infrastructure,\u201d said Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill.\n\n\u201cLNG continues to have an enormous positive economic impact for our state \u2014 especially on our hard-hit coastal communities, which continue to recover from a recent series of devastating hurricanes. Jobs like these grow the economy, reduce crime, and help address the out-migration problem,\u201d she continued. \u201cThe people of Louisiana are proud to power this nation. I\u2019m ready to fight for them.\u201d\n\nIn a surprise move in January, Biden ordered the DOE to pause pending permits for LNG export facilities while federal officials conduct a rigorous environmental review assessing the projects\u2019 carbon emissions, which could take more than a year to complete. The action was lauded by climate activists who have loudly called for such a move, which they said would help combat global warming.\n\nHowever, the move was blasted by industry groups, former federal officials and bipartisan lawmakers, who noted energy exports are vital for aiding allies in Europe and Asia. In the aftermath of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine two years ago, U.S. LNG largely filled the void left by Russian natural gas as U.S. allies sought to wean off Russian exports and punish the nation\u2019s economy, a plan Biden endorsed at the time.",

The US supreme court rejected attempts to keep Trump off the ballot under the 14th amendment to the constitution, which bars insurrectionists from office.\n\nThe Times said it obtained the redacted transcript of the valet\u2019s testimony from House Republicans who claim the January 6 committee omitted from its hearings and report anything that did not suit its narrative.\n\nTranscripts contradicting sensational testimony from Cassidy Hutchinson, a close aide to Trump\u2019s final chief of staff, Mark Meadows, have already been released.\n\nBarry Loudermilk of Georgia, the Republican leading the effort to undermine the work of the January 6 committee, told the Times there was \u201csome testimony in [the valet transcript] that may not be favorable to Trump\u201d but said: \u201cWe\u2019re putting it all out there, not doing what the select committee did, and putting things out there that will be favorable to our side.\u201d\n\nBennie Thompson, the Mississippi Democrat who chaired the January 6 committee, which included two anti-Trump Republicans, told the Times: \u201cDespite Mr Loudermilk\u2019s attempts to rewrite the violent history of January 6, the facts laid out in the select committee\u2019s final report remain undisputed \u2013 and nothing substantive was left out nor hidden.\n\n\u201cWhile the valet did not witness everything that happened in the White House that day, the testimony confirms Trump\u2019s indifference to the violence and his anger at Vice-President Pence for performing his duty under the constitution.\u201d\n\nThe unnamed valet said he did not remember Trump calling Pence what the Times called \u201can expletive meant to refer to a wimp\u201d, otherwise widely reported to have been the word \u201cpussy\u201d.\n\nAs the Times noted, Trump has not disputed the insult that was described to the January 6 committee by a former chief of staff to Ivanka Trump, the former president\u2019s daughter.\n\nThe valet also said he did not remember Trump or any staff member commenting on how rioters chanted for Pence to be hanged. Hutchinson told the committee she heard aides saying Trump said Pence \u201cdeserved\u201d such a fate.\n\nThe valet said he heard Trump ask aides about how to send national guard troops to the Capitol, a deployment that took several hours as chaos reigned and a contentious issue since.\n\nThe valet also described \u201cdisbelief\u201d among White House staff as the situation at the Capitol worsened and Trump persisted in watching TV.\n\nPence escaped the rioters and ultimately returned to the Capitol to preside over certification, despite objections from 147 Republicans in the House and Senate. According to Trump\u2019s valet, the president \u201cjust mentioned that Mike let him down, and that was it\u201d.\n\nTrump has been proved right, however, about Pence committing a \u201cpolitical career killer\u201d. Portrayed as a hero by the January 6 committee, Pence ran against Trump for the Republican presidential nomination. Failing to make an impact, he withdrew well before the first primary vote.\n\nLast week, he exacted a measure of revenge \u2013 by refusing to endorse Trump in his rematch with Biden.\n\nBut Pence also said his differences with Trump were \u201cnot personal\u201d \u2013 and refused to say he would not vote for him.",

He knows that the hundreds of thousands of pages of records he\u2019s received have refuted his false allegations. This is a sad stunt at the end of a dead impeachment. Call it a day, pal.\u201d\n\nHunter Biden, who has pleaded not guilty to federal tax and gun charges, has testified in private. So has James Biden, the president\u2019s brother.\n\nWednesday\u2019s hearing featured two Republican witnesses, both former associates of Hunter Biden. Tony Bobulinski appeared in person. Jason Galanis appeared by video link from prison in Alabama, where he is serving a near-16-year sentence for fraud.\n\nAnother key source for Republicans, Alexander Smirnov, was recently imprisoned in Nevada after being charged with lying to the FBI about supposed corruption involving the Biden family. Smirnov has also been linked to Russian intelligence.\n\nOn Wednesday, Bobulinski and Galanis claimed Joe Biden was involved in family business activities, though a meeting described by Bobulinski took place in 2017, after Biden left office as vice-president and years before he beat Donald Trump to become president.\n\nDemocrats called Lev Parnas, a Ukrainian-American businessman who worked with Rudy Giuliani on Trump\u2019s attempts to find dirt on the Bidens in Ukraine, efforts that led to the first of two Trump impeachments.\n\n\u201cThe only information ever pushed on the Bidens and Ukraine has come from one source and one source only: Russia and Russian agents,\u201d Parnas said.\n\nAmid grandstanding from members of both parties, Democrats sought to persuade the watching public the Republican impeachment effort was dead.\n\n\u201cOur colleagues now are apparently preparing to save face by ending the impeachment farce with criminal referrals,\u201d said Jamie Raskin, the ranking Democrat on the oversight committee. \u201cBut criminal referrals require evidence of crimes. And the only crimes we have seen are those of the GOP\u2019s own star witnesses.\u201d\n\nThe attempt to impeach Joe Biden, Raskin said, had become \u201cperhaps the most spectacular failure in the history of congressional investigations\u201d.\n\nIn his pushback efforts, Sams also cited commentators\u2019 responses. Among them was Charlie Sykes, an anti-Trump Republican who spoke to MSNBC.\n\n\u201cWhat happened today was truly amazing even by our standards,\u201d Sykes said. \u201cIt is one thing to say that this thing is falling apart but that actually understates how horrifically bad this is.\n\n\u201cThis was dumb and dumber.\u201d",

            "text": "Spread the love\n\nFrom Master Resource\n\nBy Robert Bradley Jr.\n\n\u201cApologies are in order from Bloomberg Green. In terms of social justice, why hurt the average person as consumer, ratepayer, and taxpayer?\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s Green-Bashing and Europe\u2019s Right Put Climate Goals at Risk,\u201d write Laura Millan, Zahra Hirji, Olivia Rudgard, and Jonathan Gilbert (maybe it takes four writers to tip-toe around the climate vs. social justice issue).\n\nThe Bloomberg Green authors call it \u201cthe campaign against climate.\u201d Realists would call it a long overdue populist campaign for energy justice and against alarmism and energy rationing. And expect a lot more such protest in the future as Net Zero fails\u2013and an \u201cenergy transition\u201d back to the real thing (dense, stock, affordable, plentiful, reliable energies) occurs.\n\nHere is the Bloomberg Green Daily story:\n\nPoliticians are vowing to roll back green policies and downplaying climate change ahead of key elections on both sides of the Atlantic, casting doubt on whether countries can maintain momentum in the transition away from fossil fuels.\n\nIn the US, former President Donald Trump, who has a long record of climate denial, is the frontrunner to challenge President Joe Biden in November. On the campaign trail, Trump has minimized the effects of climate change, attacked electric vehicles and pledged to repeal Biden\u2019s signature climate law.\n\nMeanwhile, in Europe, polls show right-wing parties that oppose strong climate action are likely to increase their representation after the European Union\u2019s parliamentary elections in June, while the climate-minded Greens are expected to lose seats.\n\nThat raises the prospect of the US and the EU, two of the world\u2019s top three climate polluters, retreating on environmental ambition following the world\u2019s hottest year on record.\n\nThe shift is a mix of backpedaling \u2014 goals being pushed back or watered down \u2014 and backlash. The growing hostility in some cases veers into outright climate denial and is part of a drift into authoritarian rhetoric that relies on attacks and emotional appeals more than traditional policy debate.\n\nHere comes the hyperbole, the religious-like premise of climate alarmists and forced energy transformationists:\n\nScientists warn that what\u2019s at stake is a livable planet. Earth has already warmed 1.2C compared to the preindustrial era, and that\u2019s on track to go up to about 2.5C by the end of the century if the world doesn\u2019t speed up the shift to clean energy. Any slow-walking comes at the risk of additional warming that\u2019s already driving disasters and costing billions of dollars every year.\n\nThat\u2019s the regular green hype. Then comes the politics, where the authors get realistic. I offer my comments (in green).\n\nClimate isn\u2019t a core issue for most voters the way the economy and security are. But the populist right has made climate policy another culture-wars flash point \u2014 an example in their eyes of costly, intrusive overreach that compromises personal choice and national sovereignty.\n\nCorrect\u2013and more. Frankly, the general public knows about exaggerated climate \u201cscience\u201d and the behind-the-scenes shenanigans from a politicized profession (Climategate turns 15 years old this year).\n\nMuch of the right believes that the bigger threat \u201cis not climate change; it\u2019s the actions taken by governments to decarbonize economies,\u201d says Mahir Yazar, a researcher at the Centre for Climate and Energy Transformation at the University of Bergen in Norway.\n\nCorrect! Just add \u201cpolicy\u201d to climate change to understand the real threat to what Alex Epstein calls human betterment.\n\nPart of the reason the political winds are shifting is that climate regulations, as they ramp up in stringency, are starting to impinge more on people\u2019s daily lives \u2014 at a time when many feel squeezed by inflation and the cost of living. \u201cDo you choose a heat pump in your house? What car are you going to drive? These are emotional things to people,\u201d said Bas Eickhout, a Dutch member of the European parliament with the European Green Party.\n\nYes, \u201cgreen\u201d policies increase energy prices and swell government budgets (and deficits in many places, led by the U.S. And yes, personal freedom to choose the best energy appliances and energies is a human preference against the Climate Industrial Complex.\n\nFar-right politicians have prospered by tapping into that sentiment. Dutch Freedom Party leader Geert Wilders won over voters last year by promising to scrap the Netherlands\u2019 climate law and exit the Paris Agreement. Libertarian Javier Milei, who has called global warming \u201ca socialist lie,\u201d became Argentina\u2019s new president in December. Germany\u2019s far-right Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) party, which rejects the decades-old scientific consensus on human-caused climate change, has promised to tear down Germany\u2019s wind farms and has recently broadened its public support.\n\nFantastic! Removing ill-performing industrial wind turbines to allow more green space is surely environmental\u2026. Climate policy is all pain, no gain, whatever one\u2019s views on the cause and pace of physical climate change.\n\nCloser to the political center, leaders are scrambling to show they\u2019re not prioritizing net zero at the expense of household budgets or consumer choice. In the UK \u2014 by some measures a world leader in efforts to cut carbon emissions \u2014 Prime Minister Rishi Sunak hit the brakes on decarbonizing as one of his ministers vowed the Conservative government wouldn\u2019t \u201csave the planet by bankrupting Britons.\u201d The rival Labour Party dropped its own pledge to invest \u00a328 billion in green projects should it win the country\u2019s next general election.\n\nSo climate policy does increase energy prices. So much for the \u201cmagical thinking\u201d that Net Zero was a free lunch or one you are paid to eat\u2026.\n\nBut abandoning pledges is one thing; undoing settled policy is another.\n\nBut failed policy needs to be rescinded. Apologies are in order from Bloomberg Green. In terms of social justice, why hurt the average person as consumer, ratepayer, and taxpayer?\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

Kennedy Jr. apologized to members of his family who objected to a new TV ad released Sunday during the Super Bowl that repurposed a spot from his uncle\u2019s 1960 campaign.\n\nThe retro-themed ad from a PAC backing his candidacy mimics the soundtrack and theme of President John F. Kennedy\u2019s 1960 campaign ad. The spot features a dramatic orchestra opening and a jingle repeating the word \u201cKennedy\u201d over and over again.\n\nThe ad also feature the lyrics, \u201cDo you want a man for president who sees it through and through? A man who\u2019s old enough to know and young enough to do.\u201d The words are a potential jab from the 70-year-old Kennedy toward his somewhat older competitors, 81-year-old President Joe Biden and 77-year-old former President Donald Trump, in a race defined by criticisms of age and mental cognition.\n\n\u201cMy cousin\u2019s Super Bowl ad used our uncle\u2019s faces- and my Mother\u2019s. She would be appalled by his deadly health care views. Respect for science, vaccines, & health care equity were in her DNA,\u201d Kennedy\u2019s cousin Bobby Shriver said on X following the release of the ad.\n\nAnother of Kennedy\u2019s cousins, Mark Shriver, replied to Bobby Shiver\u2019s post by saying \u201cI agree with my brother @bobbyshriver simple as that.\u201d\n\nBobby and Mark Shriver are sons of Eunice Kennedy Shriver, sister of President Kennedy and the late Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy.\n\nKennedy responded to criticism from Bobby Shriver by apologizing.\n\n\u201cBobby. I\u2019m so sorry if that advertisement caused you pain. The ad was created and aired by the American Values Superpac without any involvement or approvals from my campaign. Federal rules prohibit Superpacs from consulting with me or my staff. I send you and your family my sincerest apologies. God bless you,\u201d Kennedy posted on X.\n\nAmerican Values 2024, the group supporting Kennedy\u2019s presidential bid, spent $7 million on the ad. More recently, the PAC faced allegations from the Democratic National Committee that it illegally contributed to Kennedy\u2019s signature-gathering efforts.\n\nKennedy has faced dissent from members of his family throughout his presidential run. On the day of he announced his intention to run for president as an independent, a group of his siblings called his decision to run against Biden in a general election \u201cdangerous to our country.\u201d\n\nKennedy has been a leading proponent of vaccine misinformation through his Children\u2019s Health Defense organization and has spent years wrongly suggesting that many vaccines are not safe. In a CNN interview in December, he walked back some of his comments and rejected the label that he\u2019s \u201canti-vaccine\u201d despite his history of spreading misinformation about the efficacy of vaccines.\n\nHe also made a series of comments in 2022 in which he compared the Covid-19 lockdowns to Nazi Germany, arguing that \u201ceven in Hitler\u2019s Germany, you could cross the Alps into Switzerland.\u201d\n\n\u201cBobby might share the same name as our father, but he does not share the same values, vision or judgment,\u201d Rory Kennedy, Kerry Kennedy, Joseph P Kennedy II and Kathleen Kennedy Townsend said in a statement in October.\n\nCNN\u2019s Liz Brown-Kaiser contributed to this story.",

SADS: Sudden Adult Death Syndrome.\n\nPull. My. Finger.\n\nThe only thing connecting all the SADS cases was the Covid vaccinations. SADS then shifted to deaths being reported as \u201cdied suddenly\u201d, since the public refused the cute acronym SADS.\n\n\u201cDied suddenly\u201d appeared much more than usual. And, we now have a report that could shed light on that expression. According to The People\u2019s Voice, the CDC is keeping secrets:\n\nThe Centers For Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) \u201creleased\u201d a 148-page study on myocarditis after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination and every single word on every page has been completely redacted. Nothing to see here, folks. The 148-page document released by the CDC was in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request by the Epoch Times\u2026\n\nMy team sounded the alarm bell years ago, and got banned from social media. I remain shadow-banned for comments I made that were true then and remain true now.\n\nThose of us sounding alarm bells over Covid vaccinations were called conspiracy theorists. We were told to \u201ctrust the science\u201c. Ok. But can I SEE the science, before I decide to trust it?\n\nReporter Zachary Steiber explained on X, \u201cSeeing some confusion about this document: It\u2019s a CDC document sent to us in response to a Freedom of Information Act request and is fully redacted.\u201d \u201cThe request asked for information about the CDC\u2019s MOVING project. The team has posted several studies, including this one. The CDC plans to submit another paper on updated findings from the project for peer review, a spokesperson told us in January.\u201d The establishment narrative around the COVID-19 mRNA vaccinations and serious health consequences including myocarditis continues to unravel in the face of public scrutiny.\n\nExcited to dive into a new FOIA on the CDC\u2019s long-term study of myocarditis after COVID-19 vaccination. https://t.co/ZZptnE02Zu \u2014 Zachary Stieber (@ZackStieber) March 7, 2024\n\nRecall that Pfizer wanted the side-effects data protected for 75 years. Only a fool would pretend not to know why.\n\nWhat is the life-expectancy of the average person? Seventy-five years?\n\nThis request by Pfizer certainly makes me wonder how many people have been hurt or killed by their experimental Mengelesque \u201cvaccines\u201d.\n\nMillions of Americans question these so-called cures. Particularly in light of new evidence proving that they don\u2019t even work. And now we get Pfizer (the first of many vaccine manufacturers) slow-walking data that likely proves what we already know. Thanks to a lawsuit, Pfizer will have to provide data over 8 months versus what would have taken 75-years.\n\nAs I predicted, those who got the shot are now concerned about side-effects. And with reason.\n\nThe \u201ccure\u201d was indeed more dangerous than the disease. Much more dangerous.\n\nThe summary is as follows:\n\nA small batch of documents released by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in mid-November 2021 revealed that in the first three months of the COVID jab rollout, Pfizer received 42,086 adverse event reports that included 1,223 deaths. The first really large tranche of Pfizer documents \u2014 some 10,000 pages \u2014 was released by the FDA March 1, 2022. Included are nine pages of recorded side effects, about 158,000 different health problems in all.\n\n\n\nSo Pfizer, et al knew early on that the shots were dangerous. These numbers are far greater than those needed to shut down these clinical trials. But Biden\u2019s administration cloaked Pfizer and other snake oil manufacturers under a blanket of immunity.\n\nThose of us who did not get the shot know for a fact that we made the right decision. A decision based on the science of common sense.\n\nStill think you should trust the science of the CDC?\n\nAs you consider an answer to that question, remember that the CDC published a BLANK report on the outcome of the vaccine on the heart of taxpaying citizens. A matter of public health, and the organization whose mission is to protect its citizens gives us zero zilch nada.\n\nDon\u2019t expect Team Biden to come to the rescue. Democrats orchestrated this nonsense or they would happily want to get to the bottom of it. The Biden administration plays along like good little puppets, as those vaxxed continue to suffer the consequences.\n\nPar for the covid course. Don\u2019t believe me; just take another look at that data.\n\nContinue reading SHOCKING: CDC Updates Covid Vaccine Data \u2026",

            "text": "Trump Media merger wins investor approval, netting Trump potential windfall\n\nShareholders voted Friday to take former president Donald Trump\u2019s media company public, a long-delayed move that will open the owner of Truth Social to stock-market investors and grant Trump a stake worth billions of dollars.\n\nThe vote Friday by investors in Digital World Acquisition authorized the special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, to merge with Trump Media & Technology Group as part of a process that will avoid a more traditional public offering.\n\nTrump will own about 60 percent of the company, which at Digital World\u2019s current share price would be worth about $3.3 billion. He and other investors could earn tens of millions more shares through an \u201cearnout\u201d provision tied to the stock\u2019s performance, Digital World said in an SEC filing.\n\nBut a lockup provision in the merger agreement will prevent Trump and other major shareholders from selling their shares for six months unless he is granted a waiver by the post-merger company\u2019s board.\n\nThat could limit Trump\u2019s ability to use the windfall to help pay off the hundreds of millions of dollars he owes in legal judgments. Trump does not have the cash to secure a bond that would delay enforcement of the $464 million judgment in a New York fraud case, his lawyers said. If he does not post a bond by Monday, the New York attorney general could move to seize his bank accounts, real estate and other assets.\n\nAny lockup change or waiver will be decided by the post-merger company\u2019s board, which will be stocked with Trump allies, an SEC filing shows. The board\u2019s nominees include Trump\u2019s oldest son Donald Trump Jr.; Trump\u2019s former trade representative Robert E. Lighthizer; Linda McMahon, who headed the Small Business Administration under Trump; and Kash Patel, who served on Trump\u2019s National Security Council.\n\nThe post-merger company, which will be called Trump Media, could begin trading on the Nasdaq stock exchange as soon as Monday under the ticker symbol of Trump\u2019s initials, DJT. That symbol was also used for Trump\u2019s only other public company, Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts, which collapsed into a penny stock in less than a decade and filed for bankruptcy in 2004.\n\nThe merger will net Trump Media $300 million that Digital World initially raised from investors. Trump\u2019s allies and company executives will also be granted bundles of shares in the new company that could be worth millions of dollars.\n\nBut trading on the stock market will also open the company to more public scrutiny, and any drops in share prices would affect the value of those stakes. Though launched as an alternative to Twitter, Truth Social retains a fraction of its online audience\n\nCritics have said Trump Media is a \u201cmeme stock\u201d with a more than $6 billion valuation they say is out of sync with its financial outlook. Trump Media lost $49 million in the first nine months of last year and brought in $3.4 million in revenue, Digital World said in an SEC filing.\n\nTwo former contestants from his reality show \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d proposed the idea of a \u201cfree speech\u201d media and internet business to Trump after he was kicked from Twitter and other social networks following the U.S. Capitol riots on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nThe company\u2019s merger proposal with Digital World has faced years of hurdles and delays since then due to investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which agreed to an $18 million settlement, and the Justice Department, which has probed insider-trading and money-laundering allegations involving Digital World investors.\n\nLast summer, when the deal\u2019s certainty was in doubt, Trump asked billionaire Elon Musk whether he wanted to buy Truth Social, two people with knowledge of the conversation told The Washington Post. The proposal went nowhere, though the two men have communicated since.\n\nMore recently, the deal has been embroiled in a legal battle royale, with four lawsuits in three states involving Trump Media, Digital World, the co-founders Andy Litinsky and Wes Moss, and Digital World\u2019s former chief executive Patrick Orlando.\n\nOrlando, who was fired as chief last year but remains in control of Digital World\u2019s biggest founding investor Arc Global Investments II, had refused to vote in support of the merger before Friday\u2019s vote, potentially imperiling the deal, attorneys for Trump Media and Digital World said in a lawsuit this week seeking to force his vote. He spoke only briefly on a shareholder call Friday and did not offer further comment on the suit.\n\nDigital World\u2019s more than 400,000 retail investors included supporters of Trump and speculators hoping to cash in on the deal\u2019s attention. One investor, dressed in a pirate costume and calling himself \u201cCaptain DWAC,\u201d live-streamed the shareholder vote on Rumble and played sounds of applause when the successful vote was announced.\n\nDigital World\u2019s share price slid 5 percent during the meeting.\n\nThis is a developing story. Please check back for updates.\n\nNews Related",

            "text": "The U.S. Justice Department and more than a dozen states filed a blockbuster antitrust lawsuit against Apple on Thursday, accusing the giant company of illegally monopolizing the smartphone market.\n\nIt\u2019s the largest in a recent string of Big Tech companies to face antitrust complaints from the U.S. government, which is cracking down on the massive industry, whose power has gone largely unchecked over the past several decades.\n\nThe complaint, said Attorney General Merrick Garland at a news conference, alleges that \u201dApple has maintained monopoly power in the smartphone market not simply by staying ahead of the competition on the merits but by violating federal antitrust law.\u201d\n\n\u201cConsumers should not have to pay higher prices because companies break the law,\u201d he added.\n\nThe long-anticipated lawsuit, which was filed in the US District Court for the District of New Jersey, comes after years of allegations by critics that Apple has harmed competition with restrictive app store terms, high fees and its \u201cwalled-garden\u201d approach to its hardware and software: Apple famously makes its tech easy to use, but it achieves that by tightly controlling \u2013 and in some cases, restricting \u2013 how third-party companies can interact with the tech behemoth\u2019s products and services. In some cases, Apple may give its own products better access and features than its competitors.\n\nThe company said it denied the lawsuit\u2019s allegations and would fight them and added that the lawsuit could empower government \u201cto take a heavy hand in designing people\u2019s technology.\u201d\n\nBut Garland on Thursday said Apple\u2019s actions have wide-ranging effects.\n\n\u201cMonopolies like Apple\u2019s threaten the free and fair markets upon which our economy is based. They stifle innovation. They hurt producers and workers and increase cost for consumers,\u201d Garland said Thursday.\n\n\u201cIf left unchallenged, Apple will only continue to strengthen its smartphone monopoly. But there\u2019s a law for that,\u201d he added.\n\nFor example, Apple allows iPhone customers to send high-quality photos and videos seamlessly to one another, but multimedia texts to Android phones are slower and grainy. The company late last year relented and agreed to improve the quality standard it uses to interact with Android phones via text message \u2013 but it still maintains those messages in green bubbles, creating a kind of class divide, critics argue.\n\nThe company also gives its own products the ability to access certain parts of its hardware that it restricts other companies from using. That unleashes an almost magical experience for how iPhones interact with AirTags, when competitors\u2019 products are far more limited in their capabilities.\n\n\u201cApple creates barriers that make it extremely difficult and expensive for both users and developers to venture outside the Apple ecosystem,\u201d Garland said on Thursday.\n\n\u2018We will vigorously defend against it\u2019\n\nThis year, European regulations forced Apple to give other companies access to the iPhone\u2019s tap-to-pay hardware chip, enabling the creation of competing digital wallets. But those rules are limited to the European Union.\n\nAnd Apple maintains a 30 per cent commission on most sales through its app store \u2013 a frequent complaint from companies that try to sell subscriptions, saying Apple\u2019s enormous share of the smartphone market forces them to pay what they argue is an unnecessarily high commission.\n\n\u201cWe believe this lawsuit is wrong on the facts and the law, and we will vigorously defend against it,\u201d Apple said in a statement.\n\nThursday\u2019s suit claims Apple has illegally monopolized smartphone markets by using a complex web of contractual terms that harm everything from text messaging to mobile payments. Among other things, the DOJ says, Apple has used its control over iOS, the iPhone operating system, to block innovative new apps and cloud streaming services from the public; degrade how Android messages appear on iPhones; restricted how competing smartwatches can work with iPhones; and hindered rival payment solutions.\n\nApple, in a statement, said the lawsuit would set a \u201cdangerous precedent\u201d and hinder its ability to make the compelling and consumer-friendly technology that have made the company one of the most valuable in the world.\n\n\u201cAt Apple, we innovate every day to make technology people love \u2013 designing products that work seamlessly together, protect people\u2019s privacy and security, and create a magical experience for our users,\u201d the company said in its statement. \u201cThis lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets.\u201d\n\nYears of scrutiny\n\nApple has shrugged off legal challenges and criticism for years that its practices are anticompetitive. Its sterling consumer reputation and a disciplined public relations and legal strategy mirror the precision with which Apple manufactures and oversees its products.\n\nBut the Justice Department\u2019s landmark suit challenges a broad range of Apple\u2019s practices.\n\nThe case represents the Biden administration\u2019s latest effort to hold a Big Tech giant accountable under U.S. antitrust law.\n\nApple was named in a sprawling House report in 2020 finding that the iPhone maker, along with Meta, Google and Amazon, hold \u201cmonopoly power.\u201d Until Thursday, Apple was the only one of those tech companies the federal government had not yet sued for alleged antitrust violations.\n\nThe legal action could weigh on Apple\u2019s stock price, which currently values the company at just under $3 trillion, and could force changes to policies, business strategies, products and applications by the tech giant. Even divestment of some assets is not out of the question for Apple, the tech company founded by Steve Jobs in the 1970s.\n\nApple\u2019s (AAPL) stock fell 3 per cent Thursday. The lawsuit was widely anticipated.\n\nAlong with a pair of ongoing antitrust cases against Google, the DOJ lawsuit against Apple is likely to become a symbol of the Biden administration\u2019s commitment to competition and lowering prices. It will also be a test of how far courts are willing to go to apply decades-old antitrust law to the modern digital economy.\n\nThe Apple case may be one of the most closely watched lawsuits brought by Jonathan Kanter, Biden\u2019s top DOJ antitrust official. Kanter, who in private practice once represented rivals to Google including Microsoft and Yelp, is viewed as part of a fresh generation of regulators.\n\nAlong with his counterpart at the Federal Trade Commission, Lina Khan, Kanter has argued that the United States has for decades allowed a wave of corporate consolidation and anticompetitive practices that ultimately harmed the public through higher prices, fewer choices or reduced innovation.\n\nApps vs Apple\n\nTo solve Android phone customers\u2019 \u201cgreen bubble\u201d issue, Eric Migicovsky, a tech entrepreneur, says an app he created, dubbed Beeper Mini, to help Android users message iPhone users without those limitations was quickly shut down by Apple.\n\n\u201cIt lasted for a total of three days before Apple started to take swings at us,\u201d Migicovsky said. \u201cTechnologically, they worked very hard to take actions to penalize Beeper Mini users by knocking the connection offline or by making it progressively more unreliable.\u201d\n\nThose kind of interactions have made Apple\u2019s app store a focus of antitrust complaints.\n\nBeginning in 2020, Apple fought a highly public court battle against Epic Games, maker of the video game \u201cFortnite.\u201d\n\nApple isn\u2019t an illegal monopolist in distributing iOS apps, federal courts have decided in that case, highlighting the difficulty of pinning Apple down on federal antitrust charges. Apple did, however, get penalized for violating a California competition law and altered some of its app store practices in response to a court order.\n\nThose rulings highlight the challenges ahead for the Justice Department, which will need to bring a strong legal theory about how Apple has allegedly harmed competition, legal experts say. The DOJ would also need to prove that the benefits Apple has delivered to consumers don\u2019t outweigh its alleged antitrust violations.\n\nEurope\u2019s bite at Apple\n\nThe U.S. government isn\u2019t the only one to pressure Apple to change its business practices. In March, a new European Union law took effect that forces Apple to make significant adjustments.\n\nIn a seismic move to comply with the EU\u2019s Digital Markets Act (DMA), Apple said for the first time it would allow users in the trading bloc to download apps from third-party app stores.\n\nBut critics including Epic are already accusing Apple of violating the EU law. Just before the DMA took effect, Epic complained to competition authorities that Apple blocked it from launching its own app store on iOS. The European Commission is investigating.\n\nUpstart turned behemoth\n\nSince its early days, Apple has pursued a reputation as an elite, high-design brand. It\u2019s often focused on a premium user experience and design aesthetic, setting its products apart from rivals such as Microsoft and Google. That limited approach worked for years, until a wave of complaints by app developers and consumers drew more attention to the potential downsides of Apple\u2019s restrictiveness.\n\nIn the era led by founder Steve Jobs, \u201cApple was a cultural phenomenon that pitted wingtips against sandals; suits against t-shirts,\u201d said James Bailey, a professor of leadership development at the George Washington University School of Business. \u201cApple relentlessly innovated. They were always steps ahead of the competition.\u201d\n\nNow, however, Apple\u2019s advances are more \u201cincremental\u201d than earth-shattering, Bailey added. \u201c[CEO Tim] Cook has been focused on financial management and expanding market share.\u201d\n\n\u201cApple\u2019s financially healthy,\u201d Bailey said, but their reputation for innovation is \u201cdimming.\u201d",

Those payments are typically lower than under standard repayment, and can be zero under some plans.\n\nBorrowers typically get any remaining debt forgiven after 10, 20 or 25 years, depending on the plan.\n\nOne complicating factor for borrowers in these programs is that they often have multiple loans, taken out at different times, Kantrowitz said.\n\n\u201cThey get at least one new loan each year in school, on average,\u201d he said.\n\nThat can mean a borrower has multiple timelines to forgiveness, one for each of those loans.\n\nMore from Personal Finance:FAFSA fiasco may cause drop in college enrollment, experts sayHarvard is back on top as the ultimate \u2018dream\u2019 schoolMore of the nation\u2019s top colleges roll out no-loan policies\n\nNow, the Biden administration is temporarily offering borrowers the chance to combine their loans and to get credit going back as far as their first loan payment on the oldest of their original loans in that bundle.\n\nFor example, say a borrower graduated from college in 2004, took out more loans for a graduate degree in 2018 and is now in repayment under an income-driven plan with a 20-year timeline to forgiveness.

Kennedy Jr. This alignment with Biden represents a firm stance against RFK Jr.\u2019s independent candidacy, which has been deemed a potential political spoiler.\n\nDuring a recent visit to the White House, which coincided with St. Patrick\u2019s Day, over three dozen members of the Kennedy family were photographed with President Biden, sending a powerful and unequivocal message of support for the current administration. Senior members of the family have been clear about their intentions, with one stating, \u201cThere was a point of having everybody there.\u201d The gathering included \u201cthree generations and four branches of RFK Jr.\u2019s relatives,\u201d illustrating the breadth of disapproval for RFK Jr.\u2019s political pursuit within the family.\n\nStephen Kennedy Smith, a cousin of RFK Jr., did not mince words when he took to social media to express his concern: \u201cOur family has always worked together, so it\u2019s difficult to speak out against a family member. But when RFK Jr decided to run he didn\u2019t call me to ask for help because he knew I would oppose his candidacy due to his misguided stands on issues, his poor judgement, and tenuous relationship with the truth.\u201d\n\nKerry Kennedy, another vocal sibling and president of the family foundation, has been at the forefront of the family\u2019s political efforts, organizing against RFK Jr.\u2019s presidential run. The Democratic National Committee (DNC) too has demonstrated where its allegiance lies. \u201cA picture is worth a thousand words,\u201d DNC spokesperson Matt Corridoni said. \u201cIt\u2019s telling that the people who know RFK Jr. best are standing with Joe Biden in this election.\u201d\n\nDespite the family\u2019s firm stance, RFK Jr. downplayed the significance of the White House visit, characterizing the family members present as \u201ca very small percentage of my family.\u201d He maintained that many of his relatives support his campaign and stated, \u201cI think there\u2019s very few Americans whose families agree with them on every issue. And our family was raised in a milieu where we debated.\u201d\n\nAs the Kennedys amplify their support for Biden, they reflect a range of emotions towards RFK Jr.\u2019s decision to run. Some are reportedly \u201cfurious\u201d and deeply concerned about the impact his actions may have on the family\u2019s esteemed reputation. This is not the first time RFK Jr. has been at odds with his family\u2014previous disagreements surfaced during the Covid-19 pandemic over his controversial views on public health.\n\nWhen discussing the division between himself and his family members, Mr Kennedy Jr acknowledged: \u201cI understand that many of them disagree with me on the war in Ukraine. They disagree with me on Covid, on some of the public health issues. They disagree with me on the free speech issues.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cSo, you know, we can disagree with each other in a friendly way and still love each other.\u201d\n\nRelevant articles:\n\n\u2013 Kennedy family set to step up its efforts to help Biden\u2019s campaign\n\n\u2013 RFK Jr. says St. Patrick\u2019s Day photo with Biden is only \u2018a very small percentage of my family\u2019, The Hill, Tue, 19 Mar 2024 13:35:00 GMT\n\n\u2013 RFK Jr insists \u2018many\u2019 family members are backing his campaign, The Independent, Tue, 19 Mar 2024 18:15:10 GMT\n\n\u2013 Kennedys visit Biden White House despite RFK Jr. campaign, New York Daily News, Mon, 18 Mar 2024 15:18:27 GMT\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

            "text": " No place in the US is safe from the climate crisis, but a new report shows where it\u2019s most severe\nCNN  \u2014  none\nThe effects of a rapidly warming climate are being felt in every corner of the US and will worsen over the next 10 years with continued fossil fuel use\ufeff, according to a stark new report from federal agencies.\n\nThe Fifth National Climate Assessment, a congressionally mandated report due roughly every five years, warned that even though planet-warming pollution in the US is slowly decreasing, it is not happening nearly fast enough to meet the nation\u2019s targets, nor is it in line with the UN-sanctioned goal to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius \u2013 a threshold beyond which scientists warn life on Earth will struggle to cope.\n\nThis year\u2019s assessment reflects the reality that Americans can increasingly see and feel climate impacts in their own communities, said Katharine Hayhoe, a distinguished climate scientist at Texas Tech University and contributor to the report.\n\n\u201cClimate change is affecting every aspect of our lives,\u201d Hayhoe told CNN.\n\nSome of the report\u2019s sweeping conclusions remain painfully familiar: No part of the US is truly safe from climate disasters; slashing fossil fuel use is critical to limit the consequences, but we\u2019re not doing it fast enough; and every fraction of a degree of warming leads to more intense impacts.\n\nBut there are some important new additions: Scientists can now say with more confidence when the climate crisis has made rainstorms, hurricanes and wildfires stronger or more frequent, long-term drought more severe and heat more deadly.\n\nThe remains of a vehicle in a burned neighborhood after wildfires in Lahaina in Maui, Hawaii, on August 18.\nThis summer alone, the Phoenix area baked through a record 31 consecutive days above 110 degrees, a shocking heatwave that was partly responsible for more than 500 heat-related deaths in Maricopa County in 2023 \u2013 its deadliest year for heat on record.\n\nIn July, a torrential rainstorm deluged parts of Vermont in deadly floodwaters. Then in August, Maui was devastated by a fast-moving wildfire and Florida\u2019s Gulf Coast was slammed by its second major hurricane in two years.\n\nPresident Joe Biden will deliver remarks on Tuesday and is expected to unveil more than $6 billion in funding to strengthen climate resilience \u201cby bolstering America\u2019s electric grid, investing in water infrastructure upgrades, reducing flood risk to communities, and advancing environmental justice for all,\u201d an administration official said.\n\nThe US needs \u201ca transformation of the global economy on a size and scale that\u2019s never occurred in human history\u201d to \u201ccreate a livable future for ourselves and our children,\u201d White House senior climate adviser John Podesta told reporters.\n\nHere are five significant takeaways from the federal government\u2019s sweeping climate report.\n\nIt\u2019s easier to pinpoint which disasters were made worse by climate change\n\nThe latest report contains an important advancement in what\u2019s called \u201cattribution science\u201d \u2013 scientists can more definitively show how climate change is affecting extreme events, like heatwaves, droughts to hurricanes and severe rainstorms.\n\nClimate change doesn\u2019t cause things like hurricanes or wildfires, but it can make them more intense or more frequent.\n\nFor instance, warmer oceans and air temperatures mean hurricanes are getting stronger faster and dumping more rainfall when they slam ashore. And hotter and drier conditions from climate change can help vegetation and trees become tinderboxes, turning wildfires into megafires that spin out of control.\n\n\u201cNow thanks to the field of attribution, we can make specific statements,\u201d Hayhoe said, saying attribution can help pinpoint certain areas of a city that are now more likely to flood due to the effects of climate change. \u201cThe field of attribution has advanced significantly over the last five years, and that really helps people connect the dots.\u201d\n\nWhat's the weather forecast for 2050?\n\n04:18 - Source: CNN\nAll regions are feeling climate change, but some more severely\n\nThere is no place immune from climate change, Biden administration officials and the report\u2019s scientists emphasized, and this summer\u2019s extreme weather was a deadly reminder.\n\nSome states \u2013 including California, Florida, Louisiana and Texas \u2013 are facing more significant storms and extreme swings in precipitation.\n\nLandlocked states won\u2019t have to adapt to sea level rise, though some \u2013 including Appalachian states like Kentucky and West Virginia \u2013 have seen devastating flooding from rainstorms.\n\nAnd states in the north are grappling with an increase in tick-borne diseases, less snow, and stronger rainstorms.\n\n\u201cThere is no place that is not at risk, but there are some that are more or less at risk,\u201d Hayhoe told CNN. \u201cThat is a factor of both the increasingly frequent and severe weather and climate extremes you\u2019re exposed to, as well as how prepared (cities and states) are.\u201d\n\nClimate change is exacting a massive economic toll\n\nClimate shocks on the economy are happening more frequently, the report said, evidenced by the new record this year for the number of extreme weather disasters costing at least $1 billion. And disaster experts have spent the last year warning the US is only beginning to see the economic fallout of the climate crisis.\n\nClimate risks are hitting the housing market in the form of skyrocketing homeowners\u2019 insurance rates. Some insurers have pulled out of high-risk states altogether.\n\nStronger storms wiping out certain crops or extreme heat killing livestock can send food prices soaring. And in the Southwest, the report\u2019s researchers found that hotter temperatures in the future could lead to a 25% loss of physical work capacity for agricultural workers from July to September.\n\nThe US is cutting planet-warming pollution, but not nearly fast enough\n\nUnlike the world\u2019s other top polluters \u2013 China and India \u2013 planet-warming pollution in the US is declining. But it\u2019s not happening nearly fast enough to stabilize the planet\u2019s warming or meet the United States\u2019 international climate commitments, the report explains.\n\nThe country\u2019s annual greenhouse gas emissions fell 12% between 2005 and 2019, driven in large part by the electricity sector moving away from coal and toward renewable energy and methane gas, the latter of which is still a fossil fuel that has a significant global warming effect.\n\nThe decline is good news for the climate crisis, but look at the fine print and the picture is mixed.\n\nThe report finds US planet-warming emissions \u201cremain substantial\u201d and would have to sharply decline by 6% annually on average to be in line with the international 1.5-degree goal. To put that cut into perspective, US emissions decreased by less than 1% per year between 2005 and 2019 \u2013 a tiny annual drop.\n\nLeading scientist explains how cities can help solve climate change\n\n03:13 - Source: CNN\nWater \u2013 too much and not enough \u2013 is a huge problem for the US\n\nOne of the report\u2019s biggest takeaways centers on the precarious future of water in the US, and how parts of the country are facing a future with either extreme drought and water insecurity, or more flooding and sea level rise.\n\nDrought and less snowpack are huge threats to Southwest communities in particular. The report\u2019s Southwest chapter, led by Arizona State University climate scientist Dave White, found the region was significantly drier from 1991 to 2020 than the three decades before.\n\nWhite said that\u2019s an ominous sign as the planet continues to warm, with significant threats to snowpack in California\u2019s Sierra Nevada mountains and the Rockies \u2013 both of which provide crucial freshwater in the West.\n\nWhite added that a lack of freshwater in the region also has significant economic and agricultural impacts, as it supports cities, farms, and Native American tribes.\n\n\u201cMountains are our natural reservoirs in the region,\u201d White told CNN. \u201cClimate impacts on that mountain snowpack have really significant negative effects for the way our infrastructure operates. It\u2019s just critical for us to protect those resources.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Donald Judd contributed to this report.\n        ",

The law, signed by Gov. Greg Abbott in December, allows police to arrest those suspected of entering the U.S. illegally. It adds \"improper border entry\" as a new criminal offense and state judges would be allowed to order deportations to Mexico.\n\nThe Biden administration sued over the law, which it said crossed into federal authority on matters related to immigration enforcement. It marks the most significant effort by a state to challenge federal enforcement since an Arizona law in 2012 \u2014 which was eventually struck down by the Supreme Court.\n\nMEXICO SLAMS TEXAS OVER IMMIGRATION LAW, WON'T ACCEPT REPATRIATIONS FROM STATE AFTER SCOTUS RULING\n\n\"Its efforts, through SB 4, intrude on the federal government\u2019s exclusive authority to regulate the entry and removal of noncitizens, frustrate the United States\u2019 immigration operations and proceedings, and interfere with U.S. foreign relations,\" the Department of Justice said in its January lawsuit.\n\nTexas, however, has said the law is necessary due to a void in immigration enforcement by the Biden administration amid a historic and ongoing crisis at the southern border, where Texas has been on the front line.\n\nGOVERNOR WHO CLASHED WITH OBAMA OVER ATTEMPTED ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION CRACKDOWN REACTS TO SCOTUS TEXAS RULING\n\n\"The President of the United States has a constitutional duty to enforce federal laws protecting States, including laws already on the books that mandate the detention of illegal immigrants,\" Abbott argued last month. \"Texas has the right to defend itself because of President Biden's ongoing failure to fulfill his duty to protect our state from the invasion at our southern border.\"\n\nThe Fifth Circuit of Appeals had blocked the law from going into effect. The Supreme Court on Tuesday evening, not ruling on the merits of the case, allowed the law to go into effect and kicked it back to the Fifth Circuit.\n\nHours later, the Fifth Circuit again put the law on hold, ahead of oral arguments on the merits of the case on Wednesday.\n\nSUPREME COURT OKS LAW LETTING TEXAS POLICE ARREST MIGRANTS SUSPECTED OF ILLEGALLY CROSSING BORDER\n\nThe battle over the law is the latest legal feud between Texas and the administration over how to handle the crisis at the border. The two sides have also fought in the courts over the construction of razor wire by Texas and the establishment of buoys in the Rio Grande.\n\nIn January, Texas seized Shelby Park \u2014 a key area of Eagle Pass for migrant crossings \u2014 and refused to allow federal officials into the area.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruling on Tuesday brought an immediate protest from Mexico as well, which said it would not accept any attempt to return migrants by state authorities.\n\n\"Mexico recognizes the importance of a uniform migration policy and the bilateral efforts with the United States to ensure that migration is safe, orderly and respectful of human rights, and is not affected by state or local legislative decisions. In this regard, Mexico will not accept, under any circumstances, repatriations by the State of Texas,\" Mexico\u2019s Foreign Ministry said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIt comes as the crisis at the border is set to be a top issue in the upcoming general election in November. Both President Biden and former President Trump visited Texas last month and made their respective pitches.\n\nTrump has called for mass deportations and has expressed his support for Abbott\u2019s efforts to secure the border. Biden has urged Congress to pass a bipartisan border funding bill hashed out in the Senate, arguing that his administration needs reforms and more funding in order to be able to secure the border.\n\nFox News Digital's Louis Casiano contributed to this report.",

            "text": "The Biden administration has announced the implementation of the most stringent vehicle emission regulations in US history. The new policy aims to drastically increase the prevalence of electric cars, setting a goal for 56% of new car sales to be electric by 2032. This initiative is forecasted to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 7 billion tonnes over the next three decades. The move has led to significant pushback from the auto industry, with companies facing hefty fines if they fail to comply with the new standards.\n\nEnvironmental advocates have largely welcomed the regulations, although there are voices within the activist community who believe the measures could have been more ambitious. The approach stands in contrast to the more aggressive strategies adopted by the UK and the EU, both of which plan to ban the sale of petrol cars by 2035, eliciting a mix of praise and critique from various sectors in the US.\n\nThe announcement comes in the context of relatively slow adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) in the American market, where EVs represented less than 8% of new car sales in the previous year. The regulation outlines annual limits on vehicle emissions, permitting the continued production of petrol-powered vehicles, provided they constitute an increasingly smaller proportion of a manufacturer's overall product lineup.\n\nNavigating the political challenges, the Biden administration seeks to balance the employment concerns of autoworkers, particularly in crucial states such as Michigan, against the imperative of addressing climate change. The controversial nature of the regulation suggests potential legal battles on the horizon, possibly from the oil industry and Republican-governed states, which may ultimately lead the Supreme Court to determine the regulation's fate.",

            "text": "Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of N.Y., speaks during a news conference on Capitol Hill, Wednesday, Jan. 25, 2023, in Washington.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., set off a firestorm of his own making last week as he decided to intervene in Israeli politics by telling Israel to abandon its leader right in the middle of sensitive negotiations with Hamas.\n\nI don\u2019t think Schumer will do that again. He heard from pretty much the world and it\u2019s clear that Schumer is out of touch with Israel or he would have known that telling Israelis what to do is likely to produce the opposite result.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fired right back, calling it inappropriate to tell an ally and a democracy when they should hold elections and who they should vote for, especially during a war. Israel is the only democracy within the region which otherwise features everything from monarchies, theocracies, Putin puppets, and terrorist regimes. In fact, 72% in the February Economist/YouGov poll see Israel as an ally and friend, while most Americans (57%) see \u201cPalestine\u201d as an enemy and unfriendly.\n\nSCHUMER CALLS FOR NEW ISRAELI LEADER TO REPLACE NETANYAHU IN SENATE FLOOR SPEECH\n\nAre Schumer and Biden genuinely motivated by the conditions in war-torn Gaza or by the politics of Michigan? There are two million people in Gaza dislocated by the heinous attacks of October 7th and the resulting war to eliminate Hamas. There are 11 million people in Haiti now suddenly thrown into riotous gang rule \u2013 yet not much of a word about them nor boatloads of aid going to them. The answer is obvious \u2013 politics.\n\nSchumer appeared to be looking to throw a bone to the left wing of the party that, for reasons of intersectional identity, now supports a movement that subjugates women and allows honor killings of gays and lesbians.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBy about 82 to 18 Americans support Israel over Hamas in this conflict and nearly two-thirds believe that any ceasefire should occur only after Hamas releases the hostages, according to the latest Harvard CAPS Harris poll. Other polls tend to incorrectly frame the conflict as between the Israeli and Palestinian peoples and even framed in this odd way, Americans support Israelis generally by about 3 to 1.\n\nKIRBY DODGES ANSWERING POINT-BLANK IF BIDEN BELIEVES NETANYAHU IMPEDES PEACE: \u2018KNOWN EACH OTHER A LONG TIME\u2019\n\nOf course, Americans support the well-being of the Palestinian people and support aid to those in Gaza. But no one would have framed World War II as whether you supported the British people or the German people. It was about Hitler \u2013 and this conflict is about Hamas, a terrorist group that captured, and is still holding, American citizens among its hostages today.\n\nThe administration agrees Hamas is an evil group but seems to have somehow bought into the idea that Netanyahu is at fault, as though any other country would do something different after an event on the scale of Pearl Harbor, which killed 68 civilians, or 9/11, which killed 3,000 civilians in a country of over 300 million.\n\nSCHUMER TRASHED FOR \u2018DISGUSTING\u2019 SPEECH CALLING ON ISRAEL TO DUMP NETANYAHU: \u2018OUTRAGEOUSLY INAPPROPRIATE\u2019\n\nThe danger in the politics of what Schumer and Biden are doing is that it emboldens Hamas and actually complicates arriving at any kind of peace. If Biden had remained steadfast in his support for Israel and put the blame on Hamas for creating a tunnel city intertwined with civilian life instead of singling out Netanyahu, Hamas would be fearing extinction and would be much more likely to send out the hostages. By blasting the Israeli prime minister for policies supported by the vast majority of Israelis, he is instead signaling to Hamas to hold out and not to worry. Help is on the way. Whether they intended to or not, that is the result of what they have done.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\n\nAnd they are not really helping themselves politically either. The truth is that the electorate is about 2% Jewish and less than 2% Muslim and when asked to name the most important issue, 2% named the Israel-Hamas policy.\n\nIn Michigan, 100,000 votes for uncommitted is a small fraction of the 10 million people there and just how likely are they to help elect Donald Trump? And the more Biden has waffled on Israel, the lower his Israel approval ratings have sunk.\n\nThere is no genocide, no apartheid or anything like it. Jews are a diverse people and of the 9 million Israelis, 20% are Arab and 5% other minorities. In fact, The Economist/You Gov polls show that 58% believe it is Hamas that is committing genocide against the Jews and not Israel.\n\nSchumer put his foot in his mouth in so many ways in attacking Netanyahu. He should stick to commenting on American politics, which is not in great shape right now. And the pressure should be one hundred percent on the leadership of Hamas, which killed Americans and is holding American hostages, to release them now or face extinction.\n\nPlaying domestic politics with the issue will only backfire.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM MARK PENN\n\nOriginal article source: Schumer taught Democrats and Biden a powerful lesson\n\nNews Related",

            "text": "Reading Time: 4 minutes\n\nEarlier this year, the Biden administration paused action on pending approvals for U.S. liquefied natural gas exports to countries without a U.S. free-trade agreement, with President Biden citing \u201dthe urgency of the climate crisis.\u201d The decision was hailed by climate activists and criticized by oil and gas industry representatives.\n\nWhile the Biden administration intended to send a message about addressing climate change, it is important to place the LNG story within the broader emissions context. LNG exports are a significant and visible part of the natural gas emissions landscape, but ultimately achieving international climate goals will require more actions that target domestic gas and global fossil fuel consumption.\n\nAccording to the International Energy Agency, natural gas demand worldwide totaled 404 million tons of LNG, or 4.067 billion cubic meters, in 2022, including 919 billion cubic meters in the U.S. The combustion of this natural gas produced 7.5 gigatons of carbon dioxide globally. This includes 1.7 gigatons in the U.S., which is 38 percent of all emissions from fossil fuel combustion.\n\nImportantly, these figures do not include natural gas-related methane emissions, a powerful greenhouse gas that substantially increases the climate impact of gas use. In 2022, the IEA estimated that global methane emissions from the energy sector were 135 million tons in addition to combustion emissions. Oil and gas \u2014 often produced together \u2014 accounted for 58 percent of these methane emissions globally, with the U.S. responsible for around 12 percent of the global total.\n\nMethane emissions estimates vary substantially, prompting efforts at improved satellite and other detection methods.\n\nLNG exports have been a growing part of the natural gas landscape but still represent a minority share. Global LNG trade reached around 550 billion cubic meters in 2023, representing about 13 percent of global gas demand. The U.S. LNG story is even more striking. Up until 2016, the U.S. exported only a limited amount from one facility. The shale gas revolution not only made U.S. gas cheaper it also led U.S. gas production to almost double over the past two decades, fueling a surge in LNG exports.\n\nUS LNG capacity has grown from 0.6 billion cubic meters per year in 2015 to 124 billion cubic meters per year in 2023. LNG plants currently under construction are unaffected by the pause and will bring the capacity to over 230 billion cubic meters per year by the end of the decade. Importantly, even after these new LNG export facilities come online by 2030, they will represent only 22 percent of U.S. domestic natural gas production and 25 percent of U.S. gas consumption.\n\nThese figures demonstrate that while LNG exports represent an important and growing use of domestically produced gas, natural gas consumption within the U.S. and its related emissions represent a bigger climate challenge. What can and will be done to address these emissions?\n\nIn this regard, it is important to understand how natural gas is consumed in the U.S. The biggest user is the power sector (40 percent), followed by industry, which it also uses it as feedstock for chemical processes (26 percent) and buildings (24 percent). Gas demand in the power sector could increase further if recent projections regarding rapidly increasing power demand prove accurate. These uses drive where emissions reductions are needed and the corresponding measures.\n\nThe literature is rich with ways to address domestic natural gas emissions in the United States and elsewhere. One example is replacing natural gas in the power sector with renewables and other lower emissions alternatives. More efficient energy use can dampen or otherwise reduce the need for natural gas combustion. Adding carbon capture, use and storage technologies where feasible and economic can also reduce emissions, notably in industry and power. Moreover, combining these strategies to different degrees can provide even stronger solutions than implementing them independently.\n\nIt is also necessary to stress the importance of methane emissions flowing from the domestic production and processing of natural gas, whether it is consumed domestically or exported as LNG or pipeline gas. Reducing these methane emissions along the whole gas value chain must remain a focus of climate action given its short- to medium-term impact on global warming.\n\nReducing natural gas and other emissions will require action extending beyond the federal government. This includes efforts by U.S. states such as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative carbon market program and California\u2019s 2022 climate action plan, as well as industry, businesses, civil society and other stakeholders. It also includes influencing other countries.\n\nWhile the U.S. currently produces only about 14 percent of global CO2 emissions, as the world\u2019s largest economy, the wealthiest nation by net worth and the second-highest emitter of greenhouse gases behind China, it sets the tone on international climate action. Without strong U.S. leadership, emissions from several countries can be expected to remain well above what is needed to avoid dangerous climate change. Understanding and addressing the potential emissions generated by US LNG exports is part of setting that tone, and it carries significance beyond the actual size and share of the LNG-related emissions.\n\nLNG is an important element in the climate agenda, but only one part of the equation. Compared to domestic natural gas consumption or global energy use overall, it is not even the biggest part of the story.\n\nAddressing emissions relating to the domestic use of natural gas and other fossil fuels and encouraging action abroad by China and other countries, should take up the bulk of our efforts. LNG-related emissions are important, but the weight of the climate change challenge lies beyond it.\n\nPhilippe Benoit is the managing director at Global Infrastructure Advisory Services 2050. He previously held management positions at the World Bank and the International Energy Agency, as well as an investment banker specializing in natural gas projects.\n\nAnne-Sophie Corbeau leads the research on natural gas and hydrogen at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University\u2019s School for International and Public Affairs and is a visiting professor at the University of SciencesPo.",

            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe Biden administration on Wednesday finalized one of the most significant pieces of its ambitious climate agenda: the strongest new tailpipe rules for passenger cars and trucks that will decisively push the US auto market toward electric vehicles and hybrids.\n\nBut in a concession to automakers and labor unions, the rules will be phased in more slowly than originally proposed and will give automakers more choices for how to comply.\n\nNearly a year ago, the Environmental Protection Agency proposed a fast ramp-up into EVs \u2014 a rule that would have ensured two-thirds of all vehicles sold were electric by the end of this decade. The EPA pumped the brakes on that plan Wednesday.\n\nInstead of pushing automakers to sell more EVs to meet stringent pollution targets, the administration is allowing plug-in hybrids \u2014 vehicles that combine gas engines and EV-like batteries \u2014 to play a much bigger role in the electric transition.\n\nIn 2023, EVs made up just 7.6% of new car sales, according to Kelley Blue Book. The new rule is targeting 35% to 56% for EVs in 2032, and 13% to 36% for plug-in hybrids.\n\nTransportation has an outsized climate impact, making up nearly a third of all US climate pollution, so even small steps can lead to significant change. Margo Oge, who previously headed the agency\u2019s office of Transportation and Air Quality, called the new standard \u201cthe single most important climate regulation in the history of the country.\u201d\n\nIn a statement Wednesday, President Joe Biden vowed the cars would be made by American workers. \u201cUS workers will lead the world on autos making clean cars and trucks, each stamped \u2018Made in America,\u2019\u201d Biden said. \u201cYou have my word.\u201d\n\nFederal officials said the rule doesn\u2019t favor electric vehicles over other types of vehicles, and will reduce nearly as much pollution as the original proposal \u2014 more than 7 billion metric tons of planet-warming emissions, along with other pollution that is detrimental to human health. By 2032, the new rule is expected to slash passenger car pollution nearly in half from 2026 levels.\n\n\u201cWithin those ranges, we got to the same place\u201d as the standard proposed last year, said Joe Goffman, who leads the agency\u2019s Office of Air and Radiation.\n\nGoffman said the agency considered different ways automakers could \u201cmix and match\u201d new vehicle models to meet the standard \u2014 by using more efficient gasoline engines, hybrids, plug-in hybrids and battery electric vehicles.\n\n\u201cBy taking seriously the concerns of workers and communities, the EPA has created a more feasible emissions rule that protects workers building (traditional, gas-powered) vehicles, while providing a path forward for automakers to implement the full range of automotive technologies to reduce emissions,\u201d the United Auto Workers union said in a statement.\n\nWhite House national climate adviser Ali Zaidi said that \u201cone of the really strong features\u201d of the new rule was its flexibility.\n\n\u201cDifferent automakers are going to approach this in different ways,\u201d Zaidi said. \u201cYou\u2019ll have some automakers that maybe have a third of their fleet be plug-in hybrid electric vehicles.\u201d Zaidi argued that would \u201ctranslate into a lot of consumer choice.\u201d\n\nCarmakers get flexibility\n\nAutomakers like Toyota, who are favoring hybrids and plug-in hybrids and moving slowly on EVs, could be big benefactors of EPA\u2019s new rule.\n\nToyota, the world\u2019s largest automaker, is among the companies that aggressively pushed back against the Biden administration\u2019s original proposal.\n\nIn a memo sent in the fall of 2023 to car dealers across the US, Toyota Motor North America group vice president of government affairs Stephen Ciccone described the EPA\u2019s original EV proposal as a \u201cmandate\u201d and \u201cdraconian,\u201d CNN recently reported. Ciccone wrote the proposal had caused an \u201cexistential crisis\u201d in the industry and suggested an option giving automakers more choice.\n\n\u201cToyota\u2019s position is that the best way to reduce carbon is by giving consumers a choice of powertrain options, including hybrids, plug-in hybrids, fuel cells, fuel efficient ICE vehicles, and BEVs,\u201d Ciccone wrote.\n\nThat flexibility is what the EPA finalized on Wednesday. But Toyota continued to characterize EPA\u2019s rule as a \u201cregulatory mandate\u201d that will force it further into the EV game than it\u2019s currently positioned.\n\nThe rule \u201crequires a precipitous shift from around 8% market share of battery electric vehicles today to more than half by 2032 \u2013 an aggressive, sixfold increase over just eight years,\u201d said Toyota spokesperson Edward Lewis in a statement. \u201cToyota will continue to lead the industry and comply with regulations, but serious challenges around affordability, charging infrastructure, and supply chain will need to be addressed before this mandate is realized.\u201d\n\nPresident Joe Biden has made the transition to EVs a signature issue of his presidency, stressing the economic impacts, in addition to the climate benefits, of cutting pollution. In August 2021, after the president announced an ambitious target that half of vehicles sold in the country by 2030 would be either battery electric, fuel-cell electric or plug-in hybrid, Biden test-drove a hybrid-electric Jeep on the White House grounds.\n\nBut political battle lines are being drawn around the EV transition. Former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee for the 2024 presidential election, has railed against EVs in his speeches. He recently characterized EVs as \u201call\u201d being made in China, even though Democrats\u2019 Inflation Reduction Act has pushed a new EV manufacturing and assembly to the United States.\n\nWith the new standard giving automakers more flexibility, EPA administrator Michael Regan denounced the characterization that the agency was setting an EV \u201cmandate.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the differences between the proposal and final, you will see that there is absolutely no mandate,\u201d Regan told reporters, adding his agency was staying \u201cwell within the confines of the law.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just Trump; the jump to EVs has some of Biden\u2019s political allies worried, too. The United Auto Workers, a powerful union that has endorsed Biden, has also expressed concerns about what the shift to EVs could mean for their workers, who believe battery-powered cars require less labor to build.\n\nBut the demand for fully electric cars is growing in the US. The nation crossed a key threshold at the end of last year: 1.2 million electric vehicles were sold \u2014 a 46.3% jump from 2022.\n\nEV adoption rates are likely to slow down this year, which is to be expected, said Trevor Houser, partner at the nonpartisan Rhodium Group. He\u2019s looking for two main signs of EV success in the coming years: whether automakers can make a wide enough variety of the vehicles Americans want to drive, and whether the cost can come down to a more affordable range of $20,000 to $30,000.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t really know before (2025) how successfully we\u2019re making that transition because the next generation of more affordable EVs won\u2019t be on the market,\u201d Houser told CNN.\n\nZaidi agreed it would take time to see whether more Americans move to fully electric cars.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s something we\u2019ll see over time,\u201d Zaidi said. \u201cBut this rule is very flexible and allows for all of those pathways to emerge, and for (automakers) to pursue those in a manner that\u2019s consistent with their strategies.\u201d\n\nClimate and health impacts\n\nWhile the climate impact of the tailpipe rules have drawn the most attention, there is a big public-health component, as well.\n\nReducing pollution from cars and trucks could help Americans\u2019 health on multiple levels, since the EPA\u2019s multi-pollutant standards will tackle greenhouse gases that cause climate change, smog and particle emissions.\n\nNo amount of air pollution is safe, and according to the World Health Organization, it\u2019s one of the greatest environmental risks to human health.\n\nVehicle exhaust is made up of all sorts of pollutants, including carbon monoxide, particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide and carbon emissions that contribute to a warming world, which is also itself a major threat to health.\n\nExposure to particle pollution ages and reduces lung function, and it can lead to cancer, stroke, heart problems, COPD and other lung and vascular issues. It can aggravate asthma and is linked to neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s and other types of dementia, studies have found. People exposed to higher amounts of this pollution for longer periods also have an increased risk of depression and anxiety. Exposure can even contribute to problems thinking clearly.\n\nParticle pollution led to more than 107,000 premature deaths in the US in just one year, one 2019 study found. That\u2019s more than the number of people killed each year in homicides and traffic accidents combined, researchers said.\n\n\u201cThese standards really provide significant relief that communities across America need from vehicle exhaust,\u201d said Will Barrett, the American Lung Association\u2019s senior director of advocacy for clean air. \u201cIt\u2019s very much setting a strong direction to ensuring the auto industry cleans up harmful pollutants and communities are better protected from traffic emissions.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\n\nCNN\u2019s Angela Dewan contributed to this report.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story misstated what kind of vehicle Biden tested on White House grounds. It was a hybrid-electric Jeep.",

            "text": "The united states is in a funk, and no a single appears to know why. Unemployment fees are lessen than they\u2019ve been in half a century and the stock market is sky-higher, but poll following poll shows that voters are disgruntled. President Joe Biden\u2019s approval rating has been hovering in the large 30s. Americans\u2019 fulfillment with their personal lives\u2014a evaluate that typically dips in times of economic uncertainty\u2014is at a around-report lower, in accordance to Gallup polling. And nearly 50 percent of People in america surveyed in January mentioned they have been even worse off than three decades prior.\n\nProfessionals have struggled to uncover a convincing clarification for this period of poor inner thoughts. Maybe it is the spate of inflation about the previous few of many years, the immigration disaster at the border, or the brutal wars in Ukraine and Gaza. But even the individuals who declare to make perception of the political world admit that these rational components just can\u2019t fully account for America\u2019s countrywide malaise. We consider that is due to the fact they\u2019re overlooking a important component.\n\n4 years back, the nation was introduced to its knees by a globe-historic catastrophe. COVID-19 hospitalized just about 7 million Individuals and killed a lot more than a million it is still killing hundreds each and every week. It shut down universities and pressured individuals into social isolation. Almost right away, most of the state was thrown into a point out of significant anxiety\u2014then, shortly more than enough, grief and mourning. But the state has not come with each other to adequately admit the tragedy it endured. As scientific psychiatrists, we see the results of this kind of emotional turmoil every day, and we know that when it\u2019s not correctly processed, it can final result in a standard sense of unhappiness and anger\u2014exactly the unfavorable psychological state that may possibly direct a nation to misperceive its fortunes.\n\nThe pressure to just go on from the horrors of 2020 is solid. Who wouldn\u2019t adore to awaken from that nightmare and fake it hardly ever happened? In addition to, humans have a knack for sanitizing our most painful memories. In a 2009 analyze, individuals did a remarkably inadequate task of remembering how they felt in the times following the 9/11 attacks, very likely simply because these memories were being filtered through their recent psychological state. Furthermore, a study released in Character previous 12 months observed that people\u2019s recall of the severity of the 2020 COVID danger was biased by their attitudes towards vaccines months or a long time afterwards.\n\nFrom the May perhaps 2021 situation: You will not don\u2019t forget the pandemic the way you feel you will\n\nWhen confronted with an overwhelming and distressing fact like COVID, forgetting can be useful\u2014even, to a diploma, wholesome. It permits persons to temporarily put apart their panic and distress, and target on the pleasures and calls for of day to day daily life, which restores a feeling of management. That way, their losses do not determine them, but as an alternative grow to be manageable.\n\nBut consigning unpleasant memories to the River Lethe also has distinct disadvantages, particularly as the months and decades go by. Ignoring these ordeals robs a person of the chance to understand from them. In addition, negating painful memories and seeking to continue as if every thing is usual contorts one\u2019s psychological lifetime and outcomes in untoward consequences. Scientists and clinicians doing the job with overcome veterans have revealed how preventing considering or chatting about an frustrating and unpleasant occasion can guide to free of charge-floating disappointment and anger, all of which can become hooked up to current circumstances. For instance, if you achieved your previous friend, a war veteran, at a caf\u00e9 and unintentionally knocked his espresso around, then he turned red and screamed at you, you\u2019d understand that the mishap on your own couldn\u2019t be the reason for his outburst. No a person could be that upset about spilled coffee\u2014the authentic root of these types of rage should lie elsewhere. In this situation, it may possibly be untreated PTSD, which is characterised by a sturdy startle response and heightened emotional reactivity.\n\nWe are not suggesting that the total region has PTSD from COVID. In truth, the majority of individuals who are uncovered to trauma do not go on to show the signs of PTSD. But that does not mean they aren\u2019t deeply influenced. In our life span, COVID posed an unprecedented threat in equally its overwhelming scope and severity it still left most Us citizens unable to shield themselves and, at instances, at a decline to comprehend what was going on. That satisfies the clinical definition of trauma: an mind-boggling knowledge in which you are threatened with major actual physical or psychological harm.\n\nBrowse: Why are men and women nostalgic for early-pandemic daily life?\n\nTraumatic recollections are noteworthy for how they change the means people today recall the previous and consider the potential. A current brain-imaging examine showed that when men and women with a heritage of trauma have been prompted to return to all those horrific occasions, a component of the mind was activated that is typically utilized when one particular thinks about oneself in the existing. In other terms, the examine implies that the traumatic memory, when retrieved, came forth as if it had been getting relived during the study. Traumatic memory does not come to feel like a historical occasion, but returns in an eternal existing, disconnected from its origin, leaving its bearer seeking for an rationalization. And proper on cue, day to day lifestyle presents lots of disagreeable things to blame for these feelings\u2014errant good friends, the rate of groceries, or the management of the region.\n\nTo occur to phrases with a traumatic knowledge, as clinicians know, you have to have to do much more than dismiss or simply recall it. Instead, you must rework the disconnected memory into a context, and thereby go it firmly into the earlier. It assists to have a narrative that can make sense of when, how, and why a thing transpired. For case in point, if you had been mugged on a darkish avenue and turned fearful of the night, your therapist could possibly recommend that you connect your normal dread with the particulars of your assault. Then your terror would make sense and be restricted to that confined circumstance. Afterward, the additional you ventured out in the darkish, maybe steering clear of the hazardous block where you have been jumped, the a lot more you would sort new, protected reminiscences that would then provide to mitigate your anxiety.\n\nMany people do not consistently remember the facts of the early pandemic\u2014how strolling down a crowded road influenced terror, how sirens wailed like clockwork in metropolitan areas, or how one particular experienced to get worried about inadvertently killing grandparents when checking out them. But the inner thoughts that that encounter ignited are however very much alive. This can make it tough to rationally evaluate the point out of our life and our place.\n\nA person cure is for leaders to persuade remembrance whilst delivering accurate and reliable facts about both the past and the existing. In the early times of the pandemic, President Donald Trump mishandled the crisis and peddled misinformation about COVID. But with 2020 a traumatic blur, Trump would seem to have develop into the beneficiary of our collective amnesia, and Biden the repository for lingering psychological discontent. Some of that misattribution could be resolved by returning to the shattering occasions of the earlier 4 decades and remembering what Us residents went as a result of. This method of remember is emotionally cathartic, and if it\u2019s performed suitable, it can even assistance to swap distorted memories with more exact kinds.\n\nPresident Biden invited the nation to grieve alongside one another in 2021, when American demise counts arrived at 500,000, and yet again in 2022, when they surpassed 1 million. In his 2022 Point out of the Union tackle, he rightly acknowledged that \u201cwe satisfy tonight in an The us that has lived as a result of two of the toughest a long time this nation has at any time faced,\u201d before urging People to \u201cmove ahead securely.\u201d But in the earlier two decades, he, like practically absolutely everyone else, has mainly attempted to progress as if everybody is again to ordinary. Meanwhile, American minds and hearts basically are not ready\u2014whether we notice it or not.\n\nBrowse: The Biden administration killed America\u2019s collective pandemic technique\n\nProbably Biden and his advisers concern that reminding voters of these types of a darkish time would develop a lot more problems for his presidency. And nevertheless, our function potential customers us to feel that the influence would be specifically the opposite. Rituals of mourning and remembrance support folks occur collectively and share in their grief so that they can return additional crystal clear-eyed to encounter each day lifetime. By prompting Us citizens to remember what we endured collectively, paradoxically, Biden could enable free all of us to more fully expertise the existing.\n\nSupply connection",

As such, the Palestinian people have been denied the benefits of using this natural resource to finance socioeconomic development and meet their need for energy.\n\nThe accumulated losses are estimated in the billions of dollars.

Their Objective Is \u201cto Wipe Gaza Off the Map\u201d?\n\nBy Philip Giraldi and Prof Michel Chossudovsky, October 20, 2023\n\nMichel Chossudovsky, Global Research, October 21, 2023\n\nBelow is the 2013 article by Felicity Arbuthnot\n\nIsrael Gas-Oil and Trouble in the Levant\n\nby Felicity Arbuthnot\n\nGlobal Research,\n\nDecember 13, 2013\n\nIsrael is set to become a major exporter of gas and some oil, if all goes to plan. The giant Leviathan natural gas field, in the eastern Mediterranean, discovered in December 2010, is widely described as \u201coff the coast of Israel.\u201d\n\nAt the time the gas field was:\n\n\u201c \u2026 the most prominent field ever found in the sub-explored area of the Levantine Basin, which covers about 83,000 square kilometres of the eastern Mediterranean region.\u201d (i)\n\nCoupled with Tamar field, in the same location, discovered in 2009, the prospects are for an energy bonanza for Israel, for Houston, Texas based Noble Energy and partners Delek Drilling, Avner Oil Exploration and Ratio Oil Exploration.\n\nAlso involved is Perth, Australia-based Woodside Petroleum, which has signed a memorandum of understanding for a thirty percent stake in the project, in negotiations which have been described as \u201cup and down.\u201d\n\nThere is currently speculation that Woodside might pull out of the deal: \u201c \u2026since the original plans to refrigerate the gas for export were pursued when relations between Israel and Turkey were strained. That has changed, more recently, which has opened the door for gas to be piped to Turkey.\u201d\n\nThe spoils of the Leviathan field has already expanded from an estimated 16.7 trillion cubic feet (tcf ) of gas to nineteen trillion \u2013 and counting:\n\n\u201dWe\u2019ve discovered nearly 40 tcf of gas, and we have roughly 19 tcf of that gas that\u2019s available for export to both regional and extra-regional markets. We see exports reaching 2 billion cubic feet a day in capacity in the next decade. And we continue to explore.\u201d, stated Noble Vice Chairman Keith Elliot (ii) There are also estimated to be possibly six hundred million barrels of oil, according to Michael Economides of energytribune.com (\u201cEastern Mediterranean Energy \u2013 the next Great Game.\u201d)\n\nHowever, even these estimates may prove modest. In their: \u201cAssessment of Undiscovered Oil and Gas Resources of the Levant Basin Province, Eastern Mediterranean\u201d, the US Department of the Interior\u2019s US Geological Survey, wrote in 2010:\n\n\u201cWe estimated a mean of 1.7 billion barrels of recoverable oil and a mean of 122 trillion cubic feet of recoverable gas in this province using a geology based assessment methodology.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, Woodside Petroleum, might also be hesitant to become involved in further disputes, since they are already embroiled, with the Australian government, in a protracted one in East Timor relating to the bonanaza of energy and minerals beneath the Timor Sea, which has even led to East Timor accusing Australia \u201cof bugging East Timorese officials during the negotiations over the agreement.\u201d(iii)\n\nWoodside\u2019s conflict in East Timor however, may well pale against what might well erupt over the Leviathan and Tamar fields. The area is not for nothing called the Levantine Basin.\n\nWhilst Israel claims them as her very own treasure trove, only a fraction of the sea\u2019s wealth lies in Israel\u2019s bailiwick as maps (iv, v, see below) clearly show.\n\nMuch is still unexplored, but currently Palestine\u2019s Gaza and the West Bank between them show the greatest discoveries, with anything found in Lebanon and Syria\u2019s territorial waters sure to involve claims from both countries.\n\nIn a pre-emptive move, on Christmas Day, Syria announced a deal with Russia to explore 2,190 kilometres (850 Sq. miles) for oil and gas off its Mediterranean coast, to be: \u201c\u2026 financed by Russia, and should oil and gas be discovered in commercial quantities, Moscow will recover the exploration costs.\u201d\n\nSyrian Oil Minister, Ali Abbas said during the signing ceremony that the contract covers \u201c25 years, over several phases.\u201d\n\nSyria, increasingly crippled by international sanctions, has seen oil production plummet by ninety percent since the largely Western fermented unrest began in March 2011. Gas production has nearly halved, from thirty million cubic metres a day, to 16.7 cubic metres daily.\n\nThe agreement is reported to have resulted from \u201cmonths of long negotiations\u201d between the two countries. Russia, as one of the Syrian government\u2019s main backers, looks set to also become a major player in the Levant Basin\u2019s energy wealth. (vi)\n\nLebanon disputes Israel\u2019s map of the Israeli-Lebanese maritime border, filing their own map and claims with the UN in 2010. Israel claims Lebanon is in the process of granting oil and gas exploration licenses in what Israel claims as its \u201cexclusive economic zone.\u201d\n\nThat the US in the guise of Vice President Joe Biden, as honest broker, acting peace negotiator in the maritime border dispute would be laughable, were it not potential for Israel to attack their neighbour again. In a visit to Israel in March 2010, Biden announced: \u201cThere is absolutely no space between the United States and Israel when it comes to Israel\u2019s security- none at all\u201d, also announcing on arrival in Israel:\u201dIt\u2019s good to be home.\u201d\n\nGiven US decades of \u201cpeace brokering\u201d between Israel and Palestine, this is already a road of pitfalls, one sidedness and duplicity, well traveled. There is trouble ahead.\n\nOh, and in demonology, Leviathan is one of the seven princes of Hell.\n\nNotes\n\n\n\ni. http://www.offshore-technology.com/projects/leviathan-gas-field-levantine-israel/\n\nii. http://m.theage.com.au/business/options-widen-for-woodsides-leviathan-partners-20131219-2znu6.html\n\niii. http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-09-04/east-timor-offers-funds-for-onshore- gas-processing/4933106\n\n\n\niv. http://www.offshore-technology.com/projects/leviathan-gas-field-levantine-israel/leviathan-gas-field-levantine-israel1.html\n\n\n\nv. http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Leviathan+gas+project+Israel+map&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ei=ntC2UvO7IcPE7Ab7rIDYCQ&ved=0CEQQsAQ&biw=1017&bih=598\n\n\n\nvi. http://www.phantomreport.com/syria-inks-oil-gas-deal-with-russia-firm#more-20238\n\n",

            "text": "\u25a0 Donald Trump, de retour \u00e0 la Maison-Blanche en novembre ?\n\n\n\n\n\nPar Fran\u00e7ois Petitjean - Consultant et analyste de la communication politique, auteur de Adworld sur la publicit\u00e9, Toxic sur les m\u00e9dias et Sine capita sur le num\u00e9rique et l\u2019IA aux \u00e9ditions du Panth\u00e9on.\n\n\n\n\n\nDonald Trump n\u2019est \u00e0 ce jour ni \u00e9lu, ni sorti d\u2019affaire d\u2019un point de vue juridique. Pour m\u00e9moire, et pour r\u00e9sumer, il reste accus\u00e9 de haute trahison et de fraude fiscale majeure, entre autres. Donc, le moins qu\u2019on puisse dire, quand on d\u00e9fend la d\u00e9mocratie, c\u2019est que son \u00e9lection possible en fin d\u2019ann\u00e9e 2024 n\u2019est pas la meilleure nouvelle attendue en Europe.\n\n\n\nMais au-del\u00e0 de son image d\u2019oncle g\u00eanant, ce qui agite le plus sont ses d\u00e9clarations multiples sur la sortie des \u00c9tats-Unis de l\u2019OTAN, en cas d\u2019\u00e9lection. A cela s\u2019ajoute le blocage actuel au Congr\u00e8s des fonds pour l\u2019Ukraine. Et, au m\u00eame titre que nous n\u2019imaginions pas la guerre revenir en Europe, nous imaginions encore moins les \u00c9tats-Unis cesser de nous prot\u00e9ger dans un sc\u00e9nario \u00ab ni alli\u00e9, ni ennemi \u00bb. Les paroles du personnage le moins respectable de la plan\u00e8te (\u00e0 \u00e9galit\u00e9 avec V. Poutine et quelques autres) ont pourtant agi comme si cette sortie \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 sign\u00e9e.\n\n\n\nLe premier effet, sans doute le plus strat\u00e9gique, est la reprise en main exprim\u00e9e d\u2019une recherche d\u2019ind\u00e9pendance de d\u00e9fense par l\u2019Europe. Comme on le sait, les discussions sont toujours longues et compliqu\u00e9es, car l\u2019Europe n\u2019est pas un \u00c9tat. Mais il faut reconna\u00eetre que les r\u00e9centes d\u00e9cisions, si elles ne sont pas encore traduites par une r\u00e9elle \u00e9conomie de guerre vont dans le sens d\u2019une active production mat\u00e9rielle et d\u2019une coordination strat\u00e9gique. La prise de conscience d\u2019une potentielle solitude de l\u2019Europe a pouss\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9velopper une recherche industrielle de d\u00e9fense. L\u2019Ukraine reste le terrain dramatique de la preuve, mais dans une urgence presque d\u00e9pass\u00e9e d\u00e9j\u00e0. (L\u2019UE vient de d\u00e9bloquer 500 millions d\u2019\u20ac pour produire 2 millions d\u2019obus d\u2019ici \u00e0 2025).\n\n\n\nLe deuxi\u00e8me effet, pour lequel la France tente de jouer les premiers r\u00f4les est la g\u00e9n\u00e9ration d\u2019un leadership politique de d\u00e9fense. E. Macron aurait pu se passer des images de boxe non indispensables, mais il reste toutefois au c\u0153ur des d\u00e9clarations d\u2019un r\u00e9veil europ\u00e9en sur les enjeux de guerre. D\u2019une coordination accrue d\u2019aide \u00e0 l\u2019Ukraine, on passe sensiblement vers une pr\u00e9paration psychologique au sc\u00e9nario de guerre d\u00e9fensive directe et organis\u00e9e face \u00e0 la Russie. Au-del\u00e0 des craintes, le \u00ab il ne faut rien exclure \u00bb ne peut s\u2019assumer qu\u2019avec une mesure r\u00e9elle des forces en pr\u00e9sence, et une d\u00e9monstration des renforts aux fronti\u00e8res de l\u2019OTAN, qui, pour 2024 au moins, reste avec tous ses membres.\n\n\n\nSur le papier, il n\u2019y a pas photo, avantage clair \u00e0 l\u2019OTAN, mais la mobilisation op\u00e9rationnelle reste lente, contrairement \u00e0 la Russie, d\u2019o\u00f9 les alertes macroniennes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLe troisi\u00e8me effet, en domino, est que le Kremlin se rend compte qu\u2019il faut acc\u00e9l\u00e9rer face au potentiel r\u00e9veil de l\u2019Europe, dont le PIB est huit fois sup\u00e9rieur \u00e0 celui de la Russie ce qui implique une \u00ab capacit\u00e9 d\u2019armement \u00bb sans que ce soit encore une r\u00e9alit\u00e9 de production. Dans ce temps de transition, les possibilit\u00e9s russes restent sup\u00e9rieures. Mais cela ne va pas durer. C\u2019est la raison pour laquelle on a vu le discours du Kremlin changer en oubliant \u00ab l\u2019op\u00e9ration sp\u00e9ciale \u00bb pour parler de guerre. Il en va de m\u00eame pour les mensonges \u00e0 r\u00e9p\u00e9tition du Kremlin, dont le dernier en date serait d\u2019accuser Kiev d\u2019\u00eatre les auteurs obscurs de l\u2019attentat de Moscou revendiqu\u00e9 par l\u2019\u00c9tat islamique : des mots destin\u00e9s \u00e0 sur-justifier la guerre. Ce n\u2019est pas que de la s\u00e9mantique, les urgences europ\u00e9ennes et russes sont conjointes \u00e0 ce stade.\n\n\n\nEnfin, dans cette r\u00e9organisation du monde, et dans l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se o\u00f9 D. Trump serait \u00e9lu, on ignore en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 quelle sera sa position d\u00e9finitive. L\u2019individu est impr\u00e9visible et il y a fort \u00e0 parier qu\u2019il se vantera d\u2019avoir pouss\u00e9 l\u2019Europe \u00e0 se d\u00e9fendre par elle-m\u00eame et qu\u2019en cas d\u2019\u00e9chec de la d\u00e9fense de l\u2019UE, il pourrait bien remettre les \u00c9tats-Unis sur le devant de la sc\u00e8ne par un d\u00e9ploiement militaire.\n\n\n\nCar rien ne lui plairait plus que de jouer les sauveurs et passer du Joker \u00e0 Batman reste tout \u00e0 fait dans ses cordes.\n\n\n\nEsp\u00e9rons toutefois que les d\u00e9mocrates am\u00e9ricains soient les plus nombreux \u00e0 voter en novembre prochain, car l\u2019OTAN avec une Europe de la d\u00e9fense r\u00e9invent\u00e9e serait la meilleure dissuasion.\n\n\n\n",

            "text": "Lawmakers in the Vermont House are poised to vote Wednesday on one of the biggest energy bills of the legislative session. Among other things, it would make every electric utility in Vermont purchase 100% of its power from renewable resources by 2035.\n\nIt would also require that a lot more of that power come from new renewable energy sources built in Vermont and New England.\n\nCost estimates for the proposal have varied widely. Here\u2019s a breakdown of what we know so far.\n\nWhat does the bill do?\n\nUnder current state regulations, Vermont utilities have to get 75% of the power in their portfolios from renewables by 2032. Of that, about 10% has to come from renewables built within Vermont.\n\nThis bill, H.289, would require the biggest utilities in the state \u2014 like Green Mountain Power \u2014 to get to 100% renewable electricity by 2030. Vermont\u2019s smaller, town-owned utilities would have until 2035.\n\nFor electric utilities that are already at 100% renewable \u2014 like Washington Electric Coop and Burlington Electric Department \u2014 they will have to ensure that as their loads grow from customers switching to electric vehicles and installing heat pumps, that extra power is coming from renewables.\n\nThe bill also proposes to double the amount of power utilities have to buy from renewables built recently in Vermont. Additionally, it creates a brand new requirement that they purchase power from new renewables built in New England, which could include offshore wind in the future.\n\nMore from Vermont Public: Vermont just adopted a Climate Action Plan. Here's how it says we should reduce emissions.\n\nOn paper, Vermont has one of the least carbon-intensive electricity sectors of any state in the U.S. However, because we\u2019re part of the interconnected New England grid, and that grid is mostly powered by natural gas at any point in time, we still consume fossil fuels.\n\nBuilding new renewables in places where there is grid capacity and storage for them is one way to decrease the amount of fossil fuels New England burns as a region, and burning fossil fuels is the cause of global climate change.\n\nOne of the core debates playing out in the Statehouse is over how much Vermont should do to reduce the region\u2019s \u2014 and our own \u2014 dependence on fossil fuels in the electric sector.\n\nWhat would this bill mean for electric rates in the state?\n\nThe short answer is: What\u2019s proposed in the bill would raise electric rates. However, at this point, there is no granular modeling that shows exactly how much.\n\nWhat really has the potential to drive cost in the policy are the new renewables, particularly ones built in Vermont.\n\nLegislative analysts put out a memo this week that breaks the cost of this bill into two buckets.\n\nFirst, there\u2019s the cost of buying the new renewable energy. The cost of renewables is coming down, but building new stuff always carries an upfront cost.\n\nThe Joint Fiscal Office estimates that it will cost between $150 million and $250 million by 2035 to comply with this new policy.\n\nMore from Brave Little State: How much does Vermont's power grid depend on fossil fuels?\n\nThen, there\u2019s what it might cost to upgrade our grid \u2014 the poles and wires and substations themselves \u2014 to make room for this new renewable power. There\u2019s more uncertainty there, but the analysts say they expect it could be about between $0 and $200 million by 2035.\n\nAnd that figure doesn\u2019t include upgrades to the distribution systems that utilities own \u2014 the more granular parts of the grid. There are major swaths of the state where that is constrained as well.\n\nFor context, the Department of Public Service projects Vermonters will spend $14.5 billion on electricity between 2025 and 2035.\n\nAt the end of the day, experts on all sides say these numbers are helpful, but it\u2019s still hard to know at this point what this policy change would mean for electric bills in the future.\n\nWhat do we not know about how much this will cost?\n\nLong story short: a lot. And a big part of that is that we don\u2019t really know what it will cost to upgrade our grid to be ready for these new in-state renewables.\n\nRight now, there are places where Vermont doesn\u2019t have the grid capacity for any more new renewables, and upgrades are expensive.\n\nBut VELCO \u2014 the grid operator \u2014 says there are some investors who are interested in building transmission lines that would go between Quebec and future offshore wind, potentially through the very burdened parts of Vermont\u2019s grid.\n\nVELCO says these projects \u2014 if they are successful \u2014 could help a lot to alleviate the cost to ratepayers of building out more transmission.\n\nHowever, transmission projects do fall through, as happened recently with the Twin States Clean Energy Link project. Transmission can be difficult to build in New England, so there\u2019s uncertainty there.\n\nThe Scott administration put out its own cost estimate earlier this year \u2014 at twice what legislative analysts landed on, at roughly $1 billion over the next decade. The estimate relied heavily on modeling by VELCO that looks at investments needed to ensure grid reliability. VELCO clarified those figures were not meant to forecast the cost of power \u2014 nor were they tailored to the policy proposal put forward by the legislature.\n\nThe administration has since agreed the new numbers from legislative analysts \u2014 $150 million to $450 million \u2014 are reasonable, but still view the estimate for transmission costs as being a bit low.\n\nRenewable developers contend that the cost estimate from legislative analysts should be viewed as a high-end forecast for cost, because it doesn\u2019t consider the volatility of natural gas prices in shaping electricity rates, though Vermont utilities tend to buy most of their power through long-term contracts that insulate them somewhat.\n\nAnd VELCO says even if Vermont does nothing to update its Renewable Energy Standard, our aging grid is going to need hundreds of millions of dollars in upgrades to be ready for the future.\n\nAre there ways to keep that cost down?\n\nYes. Some environmental groups are saying Vermont needs a parallel policy that forces those new renewables to be built in the places where there is grid capacity for them \u2014 and load demand for them.\n\nThis would allow the state to maximize its existing infrastructure, potentially forestalling pricey upgrades.\n\nThe state doesn\u2019t require that right now, which is part of how we got to this situation of imbalance \u2014where parts of the grid are at risk of being overburdened.\n\nThe Scott administration has advocated for only requiring as many new in-state renewables as we have capacity for with existing infrastructure. Renewable developers and most environmental groups contend this bill does just that.\n\nAdditionally, the Joint Fiscal Office says utilities could play a role in mitigating costs by building out storage and creating more programs to spread out electricity use over the course of the day, like incentivizing people to charge their electric vehicles at night, for example.\n\nWhy do lawmakers feel this is necessary right now? What do people say about whether we should do this?\n\nVermont\u2019s Climate Action Plan and Comprehensive Energy Plan both call on the state to go to 100% carbon-free electricity.\n\nEven though there\u2019s been disagreement between lawmakers and the Scott administration over how to get there, both bodies support that transition.\n\nAn earlier proposal from the Scott administration had proposed requiring every utility in the state reach 100% clean energy, which would include nuclear power, by 2030, with lower requirements for purchasing new renewables.\n\nThe administration argues the emissions benefit from that approach, for Vermont, would be greater sooner than what is proposed now \u2014 though TJ Poor, director of utilities planning for the Department of Public Service, acknowledged in an interview that the societal emissions benefit of H.289 is greater because it requires utilities to support more new renewables.\n\nH.289, the bill heading to the House floor, has broad support from utilities in the state and from renewable developers, as well as several environmental groups, including VPIRG.\n\nHowever, some conservative lawmakers and the environmental group Vermonters for a Clean Environment \u2014 which has often opposed new renewable energy development in the state over concerns about land use \u2014 say Vermont\u2019s power is clean enough as it is.\n\nAnd they point out that utilities and renewable developers, who broadly support the bill, stand to benefit financially from it \u2014 especially from this requirement for new renewables within Vermont.\n\nTo date, no one has modeled how much the bill would reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Vermont, or in the region.\n\nAnnette Smith of Vermonters for a Clean Environment says she has concerns about whether the bill asks Vermonters to pay for environmental benefits people in other states will enjoy.\n\nHowever, she supports elements of the policy \u2014 including eliminating group net metering and efforts to stand up a community solar program in the state.\n\n\u201cBut the rest of this \u2014 changing the requirements for in-state [renewables] and for totals by certain years? We\u2019re not ready for it,\u201d she says.\n\nMore from Vermont Public: New report explores how sourcing 100% of Vermont's electricity from renewables would affect rates\n\nOthers say Vermont needs to do everything it can to fight climate change right now, and cleaner electricity is part of that.\n\nRep. Laura Sibilia is an Independent from Dover who sits on the House Energy and Environment Committee, and says lawmakers are also deeply concerned about affordability. She called the earlier, more speculative forecast from the Scott administration \u201cpolitical.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe energy transition is not optional,\u201d she said in early March. \u201cHow we act in it \u2014 we have a lot of options. But it\u2019s happening. Vermonters themselves are driving that transition, global markets are driving that transition.\u201d\n\nTJ Poor, director of utility planning for the Department of Public Service, says his department would like to see the cost of distribution system upgrades included in the analysis.\n\n\u201cI think the focus is that there are costs. They are significant. And there are ways to mitigate the potential risk of those costs,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I hope that this legislation \u2026 as it goes forward, that that can be an improvement.\u201d\n\nBen Edgerly-Walsh, with VPIRG \u2014 which has lobbied in support of the bill \u2014 says the numbers say otherwise.\n\n\u201cI think that what the Joint Fiscal Office has confirmed is that this is an affordable way of deploying a whole lot of new renewable energy,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019ve testified to all along and when they dove deeper into the substance of the bill, that\u2019s exactly what they found as well.\u201d\n\nVermont is part of the U.S Climate Alliance, a group of 25 states that have agreed to keep complying with the Paris Accords, even if our federal government pulls out, which we did under former President Donald Trump \u2014 though President Joe Biden has since rejoined. As the presidential election approaches, there are many who make the case that there is power in individual states taking action on climate change.\n\nHave questions, comments or tips?

It also notes that the FBI is currently investigating the case.\n\n\u201cMy clients and I welcome the DOJ investigation,\u201d Lindquist told CNN, \u201cWe want accountability. We want answers. We want safer Boeing planes. And a DOJ investigation helps advance our goals.\u201d\n\nAttorney Robert Clifford, who represents many family members of the 2019 crash victims of a Boeing 737 Max jet flown by Ethiopian Air as well as some of the recent Alaska Air passengers, said some of his clients on Alaska Air also got the letter notifying them that they could be crime victims.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m certain everyone on the plane will be getting this letter,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThe families of the Ethiopian Air victims should have also been considered crime victims.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the letters that went out to passengers, flight attendants aboard Alaska Air Flight 1282 have been interviewed by investigators from the Justice Department, according to people familiar with the situation.\n\nThe letters were first reported by the Wall Street Journal earlier this month.\n\n\u201cThe FBI does not confirm or deny the existence of an investigation,\u201d FBI Seattle\u2019s Public Affairs Office wrote in an email to CNN, citing Department of Justice policy.\n\nBoeing\u2019s potential criminal liability\n\nBut Justice opened a probe into the incident and Boeing in February, CNN has previously reported. That investigation carries the potential to upend a controversial deferred prosecution agreement that Boeing reached with the Justice Department in the final month of the Trump administration.\n\nThe settlement, which was criticized by families of crash victims and members of Congress, was over charges that Boeing defrauded the Federal Aviation Administration during the original certification process for the 737 Max jets. Boeing agreed to pay $2.5 billion as part of that settlement, but most of that was money Boeing had already agreed to pay to the airlines that had purchased the Max jets grounded for 20 months following the Ethiopian Air crash and an earlier crash in Indonesia.\n\nThe deferred prosecution agreement could have ended the threat of Boeing facing criminal liability for those earlier fraud charges. But the Alaska Air incident came just days before a three-year probation-like period was due to end, so the criminal probe could expose Boeing to charges not just for the Alaska Air incident but also the earlier allegations of criminal wrongdoing.\n\nBoeing declined to comment.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nCrashes and Disasters |\n\nDelta pilot found drunk before transatlantic flight \u2026read more\n\nSource:: The Mercury News \u2013 Entertainment\n\n(Visited 1 times, 1 visits today)",

            "text": "Donald Trump on Tuesday filed a U.S. Supreme Court brief in his bid for criminal immunity for trying to overturn his 2020 election loss, arguing that a former president enjoys \"absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for his official acts.\"\n\nThe case is due to be argued before the justices on April 25. Trump has appealed a lower court's rejection of his request to be shielded from the criminal case being pursued by Special Counsel Jack Smith because he was serving as president when he took the actions at the center of the case.\n\nThe filing advances arguments similar to ones Trump's lawyers previously have made and echoes statements he has made on the campaign trail as he seeks to regain the presidency.\n\n\"The president cannot function, and the presidency itself cannot retain its vital independence, if the president faces criminal prosecution for official acts once he leaves office,\" the filing said.\n\nTrump, the first former president to be criminally prosecuted, is the Republican candidate challenging Democrat President Joe Biden in the Nov. 5 election. Biden defeated Trump in 2020.\n\n\"A denial of criminal immunity would incapacitate every future president with de facto blackmail and extortion while in office, and condemn him to years of post-office trauma at the hands of political opponents. The threat of future prosecution and imprisonment would become a political cudgel to influence the most sensitive and controversial presidential decisions, taking away the strength, authority and decisiveness of the presidency,\" according to Trump's filing.\n\nSmith was appointed by U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland in November 2022. In August 2023, Smith brought four federal criminal counts against Trump in the election subversion case, including conspiring to defraud the United States, obstructing the congressional certification of Biden's electoral victory and conspiring to do so, and conspiring against right of Americans to vote.\n\nIn a filing to the justices in February, Smith sought to make the case against presidential immunity.\n\n\"The nation has a compelling interest in seeing the charges brought to trial,\" Smith said in the filing, adding that \"the public interest in a prompt trial is at its zenith where, as here, a former president is charged with conspiring to subvert the electoral process so that he could remain in office.\"\n\nSmith said Trump's criminal charges reflect an alleged effort to \"perpetuate himself in power and prevent the lawful winner of the 2020 presidential election from taking office. The charged crimes strike at the heart of our democracy.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision to hear arguments on Trump's immunity bid next month postponed the trial, giving him a boost as he tries to delay prosecutions while running to regain the presidency. Trump has three other pending criminal cases. He has pleaded not guilty in all four cases, seeking to paint them as politically motivated.\n\nTrump last October sought to have the charges dismissed based on his claim of immunity. U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan rejected that claim in December.\n\nOn appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on Feb. 6 ruled 3-0 against Trump's immunity claim, rejecting his bid for \"unbounded authority to commit crimes that would neutralize the most fundamental check on executive power - the recognition and implementation of election results.\"\n\nThe case once again thrusts the nation's top judicial body, whose 6-3 conservative majority includes three justices appointed by Trump, into the election fray.\n\nTrump and his allies made false claims that the 2020 election was stolen and devised a plan to use false electors to thwart congressional certification of Biden's victory. Trump also sought to pressure then-Vice President Mike Pence not to allow certification to go forward. Trump's supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in a bid to prevent the certification.\n\nIf Trump regains the presidency, he could seek to use his powers to force an end to the prosecution or potentially pardon himself for any federal crimes.",

Trump recently made controversial comments that received pushback, including that immigrants are \u201cpoisoning the blood\u201d of America, and said that some undocumented immigrants as \u201cnot people.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe only cares about the wealthy,\u201d Biden said on Tuesday, referring to Trump.\n\nThe president highlighted Latino members of his administration, including Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Xavier Becerra and Education Secretary Miguel Cardona.\n\nThe focus on Latinos comes as Biden\u2019s campaign launched a national program to engage and mobilize Latino voters. Latinos con Biden-Harris kicked off on Tuesday and is intended to jump-start a series of events to engage, train, and mobilize Latino supporters.\n\nBiden went to Nevada and Arizona with the strategy to target Trump on top issues like immigration, as well as defending democracy, abortion rights, and unions.\n\nBiden lags behind Trump in Arizona, with the former president holding a 5.1 percent lead, according to an aggregation of polls by Decision Desk HQ. Trump is also ahead in Nevada, holding a 5.7 percent lead, according to an aggregation of polls.\n\nThe president earlier on Tuesday, while in Nevada, defended his low poll numbers and said that in the last few national polls, he was beating Trump. He called the press all \u201cgood guys,\u201d as some Democrats have pushed back on the media\u2019s focus on the president\u2019s poor polling numbers against Trump.",

You just can\u2019t describe it verbally.\u201d\n\nAt 6:30 a.m. it was still dark in Rome, Ga. But people had been lined up for a long time already, still nearly 12 hours before Trump was set to take the stage at another of his rallies.\n\nSome had waited all night amid the crowd-control gates, in the bottom level of a downtown parking garage. At the very front of the line, Sharon Anderson waited under a blanket on a camp chair.\n\nShe told me this was her 50th rally. Why does she attend so many?\n\n\u201cI want to show my support for the best president in the history of this nation,\u201d she explained.\n\nAnderson and some friends were all wearing tops styled to look like baseball shirts, with a big \u201c47\u201d on the back (for Trump\u2019s quest to be the 47th president) and \u201cFRONT ROW JOES\u201d on the front. Those \u201cJoes\u201d are a team of Trump superfans who get right up front at rallies.\n\nI asked Anderson how she would describe a Trump rally to someone who has never been to one.\n\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s very uplifting, encouraging, exciting,\u201d she said. \u201cYou just can\u2019t describe it verbally.\u201d\n\nMany Americans won\u2019t share her experience \u2014 or her view \u2014 and will instead witness Trump events through viral clips of his at times violent, anti-democratic rhetoric \u2014 for example, his recent dehumanizing language about migrants and comments about a \u201cbloodbath\u201d should Joe Biden win a second term.\n\nAnd that\u2019s important. But nine years in, these surreal events say so much more about the continued Trump phenomenon.\n\nA Trump rally has the feel of an all-day pep rally mixed with a megachurch service \u2014 except with Trumpism as the religion. The rallies are places where a movement largely defined by grievance can be together, away from opponents \u2014 not to mention assertions that Trump lies and is harmful to democracy.\n\nThey are places to see that for many Americans, Trumpism isn\u2019t just about politics; it\u2019s a core part of their identities.\n\ntoggle caption ELIJAH NOUVELAGE/AFP via Getty Images\n\nELIJAH NOUVELAGE/AFP via Getty Images\n\nFamilies, fandoms, and \u2018FJB\u2019\n\nFor the next hundred years, this is going to be talked about. And my kids will be able to say, \u2018Hey, I was there. My mom took me to that. I saw that man.'\u201d\n\nNot far away from Sharon \u2014 maybe 20th in line \u2014 Lauren Tucker waited. She and her mother traded off holding their place in line overnight. This would be her first rally.\n\n\u201cEverybody here, all the people that were in line before us, they have been so amazing all night long. And they told us exactly what to expect. They helped us get our little buttons and they\u2019ve just been wonderful,\u201d Tucker exclaimed. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a little family.\u201d\n\nTucker is the mother of six, and her 6-year-old son played on a tablet next to her.\n\n\u201cIt was very important for me to have my kids be here because this is something that, A, they\u2019re going to remember, and, B, this is going to be talked about for years,\u201d she said. \u201cFor the next hundred years, this is going to be talked about. And my kids will be able to say, \u2018Hey, I was there. My mom took me to that. I saw that man.'\u201d\n\nTucker was wearing red white and blue eyeshadow and an American flag cowboy hat.\n\nAnd this is a hallmark of Trump rallies: people dress up for them in a way they don\u2019t for other politicians.\n\nMerch sellers like Amber Johnson add to a growing sea of Trumpwear. Johnson is a Trump supporter herself \u2014 she calls herself a \u201cRepublican Mississippi hippie\u201d \u2014 and compares the rallies to rock concerts. She speaks from experience.\n\ntoggle caption ELIJAH NOUVELAGE/AFP via Getty Images\n\nELIJAH NOUVELAGE/AFP via Getty Images\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of the same vibe. So I followed Dead & Company and Phish around all summer, and now I\u2019m out here doing the same thing, but selling political merchandise,\u201d she said with a laugh.\n\nAnd this is one way to understand what makes Trump such a singular phenomenon. His fans aren\u2019t just out to hear a political message; they\u2019re participating in a fandom \u2014 a political version of Deadheads or Parrotheads.\n\nThen again, there\u2019s a combativeness at a Trump concert that doesn\u2019t exist at a Phish concert \u2014 or at a Biden event, for that matter.\n\nOne man nearby sold t-shirts printed with vulgar, sexually explicit statements about Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and Nancy Pelosi. Among Johnson\u2019s tamer shirts was one that read, \u201cIf you don\u2019t like Trump, then you probably won\u2019t like me, and I\u2019m OK with that.\u201d\n\nAnother read \u201cFJB,\u201d where the JB stands for Joe Biden and the F is an expletive.\n\nCarli Godfrey is 16 and came with her grandmother, in matching t-shirts. She read the defiant phrase written across their chests: \u201cI\u2019m still a Trump girl. I make no apologies.\u201d\n\nI asked Godfrey what that means \u2013 does she think people want her to make apologies? She answered that even in uberconservative northwest Georgia, her politics differ from some of her peers\u2019.\n\n\u201cBeing in high school, some people are like, \u2018Why are you doing that?'\u201d she said, referring to her Trump fandom. \u201cI mean, a lot of people \u2014 this is going to sound really sad, but a lot of people don\u2019t stand for [the] flag. But I do. I always will.\u201d\n\ntoggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nChip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nThe grievance of the underdog\n\nWhat\u2019s so frustrating is that the leftist wing focuses so much on minorities that it feels like me as a white man, that I am the minority.\u201d\n\nThe aggressive merch suggests that wearers expect, even relish, opposition. And Trump rallies have perhaps a more confrontational feel than ever, amid his four indictments, and his insistence that he won in 2020. All the voters I asked about 2020 also think Trump won that election. He didn\u2019t.\n\nMidmorning, a few hundred deep into the line, Angie Patrick had just helped a friend wriggle into a new t-shirt reading \u201cGod, Guns, and Trump\u201d. Patrick said me she has her own way of fighting for the former president.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a digital warrior. That means sharing things that perhaps maybe the mainstream media doesn\u2019t necessarily share with the public,\u201d she explained.\n\nShe mentioned multiple conspiracy theories she believes in and said she had been kicked off of Twitter 31 times (pre-Elon Musk\u2019s tenure, that is).\n\nTo Patrick, Trump is beleaguered and bullied\u2026but also massively powerful. It\u2019s a careful needle he has managed to thread with his followers.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s beaten the odds. And I like an underdog,\u201d she said. But she quickly added, \u201calthough I don\u2019t think Trump is an underdog. I think he\u2019s definitely the front dog.\u201d\n\nA lot of Trump\u2019s supporters themselves feel like underdogs.\n\nBy mid-afternoon, people were taking their seats in the city arena. One of them, college student Zachary Wright, said he feels economically strapped, but also feels marginalized culturally.\n\n\u201cIf the economy keeps on getting worse and worse and worse, then how much is it going to cost for my kids to get lunch? And not only that, what\u2019s so frustrating is that the leftist wing focuses so much on minorities that it feels like me as a white man, that I am the minority.\u201d\n\nWe versus \u2018they\u2019\n\nAll afternoon, people queued for concessions and restrooms, chatting with their fellow Trump disciples.\n\nBut the mood darkened as Trump\u2019s opening act took the stage \u2014 a run of right-wing politicians. Their message was that the Trump movement has an endless string of enemies outside the arena.\n\nRepresentative Marjorie Taylor Greene, for example, repeatedly referenced a nameless \u201cthey.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe said build the wall. And they were offended. We said back the blue and they were offended, right?\u201d she added, as the crowd started booing in agreement.\n\ntoggle caption Danielle Kurtzleben/NPR\n\nDanielle Kurtzleben/NPR\n\nAt a Trump rally, even the rioters who attacked the capitol on Jan. 6 are recast as victims of anti-Trump forces.\n\n\u201cLadies and gentlemen,\u201d an announcer\u2019s deep voice boomed over dramatic music. \u201cPlease rise for the horribly and unfairly treated January 6 hostages.\u201d\n\nLately, Trump takes the stage after a recording of the national anthem sung by those jailed for that attack. While Trump\u2019s indictment for his actions on Jan. 6 looms over his campaign, he also embraces that day. Indeed, he has said he plans to pardon many of the convicted rioters.\n\nTrump started speaking in Rome at around 6:00 p.m., about an hour late. He would remain on stage for nearly 2 hours \u2014 long even for a Trump rally speech.\n\nAs usual, the demonization of undocumented immigrants was a key focus and drew loud cheers.\n\n\u201cWhat Joe Biden has done on our border is a crime against humanity and the people of this nation for which he will never be forgiven. We\u2019re going to fix it. We\u2019re going to fix it fast. We\u2019re going to have the largest deportation in history,\u201d he said, to thunderous applause.\n\nEven when his particular wording doesn\u2019t make headlines, Trump\u2019s speeches are full of false \u2014 and sometimes strange \u2014 rhetoric about migrants.\n\n\u201cThey always say suburban housewives, they want something that\u2019s very important: security,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201cThey don\u2019t want illegal immigrants coming into our country. They don\u2019t want illegal immigrants knocking on their front door and saying, \u2018I\u2019m going to use your kitchen, and I\u2019m going to use your bedroom, and there\u2019s not a damn thing-\u2018 And that\u2019s the nice ones, okay?\u201d\n\nThe speech went beyond immigration though, meandering toward many more of trump\u2019s grievances \u2014 yes, against Joe Biden, but also Fulton County, Ga., prosecutor Fani Willis, N.Y. Attorney General Letitia James, Megyn Kelly and Martha Stewart\u2026to name a few.\n\nIn addition, he praised Hungarian autocrat Viktor Orban and North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un.\n\nAfter it all, the evening ended with a familiar benediction: \u201cWe will make America great again.\u201d\n\nJust outside, Tynisha Williams said she had a great time. She added \u2014 paradoxically \u2014 she thinks Trump\u2019s divisiveness will unify the U.S.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for the kid gloves to be taken off,\u201d she said. \u201cYou need to know the hard truth. And the hard truth is we need to come back together as a country. We need to get this country back together. And we got to unite. We gotta make this country great again, as simple as that.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how Trump would unite the nation, however. A week later, at another rally, he would say that some undocumented immigrants aren\u2019t people, whipping up another firestorm of controversy.",

Please enter a valid email address.\n\nWhile House and Senate conservatives railed against the $1.2 trillion federal funding bill that passed Friday, as the de facto leader of the Republican Party remained silent.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, the GOP\u2019s presumptive 2024 nominee, made no public comments, and his campaign did not respond to multiple requests for comment on the bill, which President Biden signed into law on Saturday.\n\n\u201cThis agreement represents a compromise, which means neither side got everything it wanted,\u201d Biden, a Democrat, said in a statement. \u201cBut it rejects extreme cuts from House Republicans and expands access to child care, invests in cancer research, funds mental health and substance use care, advances American leadership abroad, and provides resources to secure the border that my administration successfully fought to include. That\u2019s good news for the American people.\u201d\n\nCongress avoided a lengthy partial government shutdown Saturday when the Senate passed the spending package 74-24 in the wee hours of the morning. The bill passed the House on Friday by a vote of 286-134, with a majority of Republicans, 113, voting against it.\n\nUS NATIONAL DEBT TRACKER FOR MARCH 22, 2024: SEE WHAT AMERICAN TAXPAYERS (YOU) OWE IN REAL TIME\n\nRepublican opponents seethed as the package moved through Congress, arguing that it did little to address the $34 trillion national debt, funded Biden\u2019s policies that they oppose and failed to include border security enforcement measures that GOP lawmakers had demanded in order to fund the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nThe final vote violated the so-called Hastert Rule, a long held GOP \u201crule,\u201d named after former House Speaker Dennis Hastert, that holds Republican leadership should allow votes only on bills that have a \u201cmajority of the majority\u201d in agreement \u2014 in other words, only if a majority of Republicans support them.\n\nThat outcome reflected deep divisions within the House GOP conference, with many Republicans expressing frustration at leadership for unveiling the 1,012-page package just 48 hours before lawmakers were asked to vote.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s total lack of backbone, total lack of leadership, and a total failure by Republican leadership. There\u2019s no other way to describe it,\u201d Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, said Thursday on former Trump White House adviser Stephen K. Bannon\u2019s \u201cWar Room.\u201d \u201cThis bill is an abomination.\u201d\n\nSENATE PASSES MAMMOTH $1.2T SPENDING PACKAGE AFTER BRIEF PARTIAL GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN\n\nSenate Republicans who opposed the package made similar complaints, with Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah., telling Fox News Digital that it was an \u201cutterly absurd, insulting and lawless suggestion that that is an appropriate legislative process.\u201d\n\nSen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., accused the bill\u2019s supporters of \u201ccaving to Biden & Schumer & voting for billions in earmarks and special interest giveaways,\u201d in a post on X.\n\nGOP firebrand Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., went so far as to introduce a motion to remove House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., from leadership, accusing him of betrayal. Other Republicans, like Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., said that removing Johnson would be a \u201cmistake,\u201d arguing that the speaker has done \u201cthe best he could\u201d with a one-seat majority.\n\nWhile Washington Republicans fight each other, Trump has not yet offered a clear vision for how he would manage these spending crises, were he to win back the White House in 2024.\n\nHOUSE PASSES $1.2 TRILLION GOVERNMENT SPENDING BILL TO AVERT GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN\n\nOn the campaign trail, the presumptive GOP nominee has insisted that he will pay off the national debt if he ousts Biden. But while Trump was president from 2017 through 2020, the laws and executive orders he signed added an estimated $8.4 trillion to the national debt, with interest, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB).\n\nIndeed, Trump was responsible for signing several trillion-dollar omnibus spending bills into law, even before the COVID-19 pandemic. Excluding COVID relief, Trump added $4.8 trillion to the debt over his four years in office, CRFB estimates.\n\nIn his first two years in office, when the House and Senate were in Republican hands, the Trump White House unsuccessfully sought to cut about $15 billion in federal spending with a recissions request. That effort narrowly passed the House and died in the Senate, where Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Richard Burr, R-N.C. sided with Democrats on a procedural vote to kill it.\n\nIn 2018, faced with a $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill, Trump backed down from a veto threat and reluctantly signed the bill, reasoning that it provided needed funds for the military.\n\nBIDEN SAYS $1.2T SPENDING PACKAGE IS \u2018GOOD NEWS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE,\u2019 BUT CONGRESS\u2019 WORK ISN\u2019T OVER\n\n\u201cI say to Congress, I will never sign another bill like this again,\u201d Trump said in remarks after he signed the bill.\n\nThe very next year, Trump signed a $1.4 trillion spending package to avert a partial government shutdown. He did so again as one of his last acts as president in December 2020, putting his signature on another massive $1.4 trillion omnibus that included $900 billion in COVID-19 aid.\n\nBut while Trump did not keep his promise to get federal spending under control in his first term, Biden is on track to exceed Trump\u2019s debt accumulation by the end of this year. In his first three years as president, Biden has added $6.75 trillion to the national debt, according to Treasury Department data. In his final year, the Congressional Budget Office projects a deficit of $1.58 trillion \u2014 which would total $8.3 trillion by the end of Biden\u2019s first term.\n\nThose estimates were made before Biden signed the new $1.2 trillion appropriations package on Saturday.\n\nBiden\u2019s fiscal year 2025 budget calls for $3.3 trillion in net deficit reduction, although the revenue that is needed to achieve that goal would mostly come from tax increases. Biden has promised not to increase taxes on those making less than $400,000, but he otherwise has called for a repeal of Trump\u2019s tax cuts and additional taxes on corporations and the wealthy.\n\nTrump has campaigned on new rounds of tax cuts, arguing that economic growth stimulated by lower taxes will make up for any loss in government revenue. But he has yet to tell voters how he plans to cut spending, or how he will work with Congress to break the cycle of last-minute omnibus spending bills that were characteristic of his first term.",

(Kevin Lamarque, Reuters)\n\nLeer en espa\u00f1ol Read in English\n\nEstimated read time: 1-2 minutes\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Joe Biden announced Thursday that $6 billion in student loans would be canceled for 78,000 borrowers, bringing his administration's total student debt cancellation to nearly $150 billion.\n\nBiden pledged last year to find other avenues for tackling debt relief after the Supreme Court in June blocked his broader plan to cancel $430 billion in student loan debt.\n\nThe latest group includes public service workers, like teachers, nurses and firefighters, who qualify under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program created in 2007 to forgive student debt for Americans who go into public service.\n\n\"These public service workers have dedicated their careers to serving their communities, but because of past administrative failures, never got the relief they were entitled to under the law,\" Biden said in a statement.\n\nAs of June 2023, about 43.4 million U.S. student loan recipients had $1.63 trillion in outstanding loans, according to the Federal Student Aid website. Higher education debt has tripled since the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nSteep interest and hefty payments on these loans mean younger Americans struggle to buy homes or make other investments, and Democrats have pushed for U.S. government forgiveness for years. Republicans largely oppose such actions.\n\nBiden is seeking re-election in November and needs the youth vote to help him win.\n\n\"I won't back down from using every tool at my disposal to deliver student debt relief to more Americans, and build an economy from the middle out and bottom up,\" Biden said.\n\nA White House official said Biden's latest move brought the total amount of debt cancellation under the Biden administration to $144 billion for nearly 4 million Americans.\n\n\u00d7\n\nRelated stories\n\nMost recent Politics stories\n\nRelated topics Education Politics",

As much as people like to incorrectly claim that our elections are somehow rigged, we do not live in Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia, where he recently received a staggering 87% of the vote in an election devoid of any meaningful opposition.\n\nWhy would I vote for somebody I do not believe should lead us?\n\nI understand why my willingness to discard that voting right is off-putting to many. It's something I wrestled with for years as a hypothetical scenario that has become a dreadful reality.\n\nMy thought process is simple: I cannot in good conscience vote for Biden, who has entirely neglected his duty as president to secure the border and has weaponized the FBI against pro-lifers, alongside countless other abuses of power and failed policies. At the same time, Trump is an unacceptable candidate due to his actions in the fallout of the Jan. 6, 2021, riot, his refusal to debate other GOP candidates in this primary cycle, and his self-admitted history of abusing women.\n\nWhy would anybody vote for these candidates?\n\nMy generation is up for grabs. Don't believe the narrative that Gen Z will vote Biden.\n\nRather than choose to vote for someone I think is entirely unfit for office, I would prefer to use my vote to tell the major political parties that they have failed. I hope other conservatives join me. Our choice to vote in other 2024 races while ignoring the presidency would send a clear message that earning the White House requires a candidate worthy of it. We can still vote in state elections that matter.\n\nWe criticize Democrats for voting for the \"Weekend-At-Bernie\u2019s\"-esque candidate: Biden. But we also need to have standards, even if that means potentially losing an election to prove that point.\n\nGen Z has a chance to voice our dissatisfaction\n\nOne quarter of Gen Z is reluctant to vote for either Trump or Biden. People from my age crave normalcy when it comes to candidate selection and had a chance to capitalize on that desire. While Gen Z does skew heavily toward the left, such a significant portion of us not being sold on Biden shows a missed opportunity by Republicans who only had to nominate a candidate capable of capturing moderate voters.\n\nPence won't endorse Trump. Here's why that doesn't actually matter.\n\nOur best course of action as a generation is to not choose the lesser of two evils, but rather show the two major parties that our votes could have been won had they chosen different candidates. While I personally would be very unlikely to vote for anyone the Democrats could nominate for president, much of my generation is ready to jump on board, especially when the alternative is Trump.\n\nRepublican voters need to realize this is bigger than winning one election\n\nAs for Republicans, we should not fall victim to the lie that the fate of the country is at stake with this election. That rhetoric is helpful for rallying voters to your side but is dishonest. Our country will survive Biden\u2019s first disastrous presidency, and it can survive another four years.\n\nOur country survived Trump\u2019s fruitless attempts to retain power after he lost the presidency in 2020, and it would survive a second term of his as well. Presidents do not determine the fate of our country, as much as doomsayers on both sides like to forecast.\n\nThe fate of America is not at stake in this specific election, but rather in all future elections. If America's two major political parties continue to offer disastrous candidates, then America will remain in political distress.\n\nMy choice to not vote for Trump or Biden is one that is rooted in concern for the future, not the tales of imminent doomsday the pundits forecast.\n\nDace Potas is an Opinion fellow for USA TODAY.

The update sheds light on the involvement of more countries than just China and Ukraine, as well as implicating a greater number of individuals in trafficking activities than just Hunter Biden.\n\nThe revelations go beyond just family members, indicating a widespread network of corruption that reaches into various sectors of society.

It is essential that we demand accountability and transparency from our leaders to ensure the integrity of our democracy.\n\nIn conclusion, the MTG with Biden Crime family update has brought to light a level of corruption and criminal activity that is deeply concerning.

That\u2019s good news for the American people.\u201d\n\nCongress avoided a lengthy partial government shutdown Saturday when the Senate passed the spending package 74-24 in the wee hours of the morning. The bill passed the House on Friday by a vote of 286-134, with a majority of Republicans, 113, voting against it.\n\nUS NATIONAL DEBT TRACKER FOR MARCH 22, 2024: SEE WHAT AMERICAN TAXPAYERS (YOU) OWE IN REAL TIME\n\nRepublican opponents seethed as the package moved through Congress, arguing that it did little to address the $34 trillion national debt, funded Biden\u2019s policies that they oppose and failed to include border security enforcement measures that GOP lawmakers had demanded in order to fund the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nThe final vote violated the so-called Hastert Rule, a long held GOP \u201crule,\u201d named after former House Speaker Dennis Hastert, that holds Republican leadership should allow votes only on bills that have a \u201cmajority of the majority\u201d in agreement \u2014 in other words, only if a majority of Republicans support them.\n\nThat outcome reflected deep divisions within the House GOP conference, with many Republicans expressing frustration at leadership for unveiling the 1,012-page package just 48 hours before lawmakers were asked to vote.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s total lack of backbone, total lack of leadership, and a total failure by Republican leadership. There\u2019s no other way to describe it,\u201d Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, said Thursday on former Trump White House adviser Stephen K. Bannon\u2019s \u201cWar Room.\u201d \u201cThis bill is an abomination.\u201d\n\nSENATE PASSES MAMMOTH $1.2T SPENDING PACKAGE AFTER BRIEF PARTIAL GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN\n\nSenate Republicans who opposed the package made similar complaints, with Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah., telling Fox News Digital that it was an \u201cutterly absurd, insulting and lawless suggestion that that is an appropriate legislative process.\u201d\n\nSen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., accused the bill\u2019s supporters of \u201ccaving to Biden & Schumer & voting for billions in earmarks and special interest giveaways,\u201d in a post on X.\n\nGOP firebrand Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., went so far as to introduce a motion to remove House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., from leadership, accusing him of betrayal. Other Republicans, like Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., said that removing Johnson would be a \u201cmistake,\u201d arguing that the speaker has done \u201cthe best he could\u201d with a one-seat majority.\n\nWhile Washington Republicans fight each other, Trump has not yet offered a clear vision for how he would manage these spending crises, were he to win back the White House in 2024.\n\nHOUSE PASSES $1.2 TRILLION GOVERNMENT SPENDING BILL TO AVERT GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN\n\nOn the campaign trail, the presumptive GOP nominee has insisted that he will pay off the national debt if he ousts Biden. But while Trump was president from 2017 through 2020, the laws and executive orders he signed added an estimated $8.4 trillion to the national debt, with interest, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB).\n\nIndeed, Trump was responsible for signing several trillion-dollar omnibus spending bills into law, even before the COVID-19 pandemic. Excluding COVID relief, Trump added $4.8 trillion to the debt over his four years in office, CRFB estimates.\n\nIn his first two years in office, when the House and Senate were in Republican hands, the Trump White House unsuccessfully sought to cut about $15 billion in federal spending with a recissions request. That effort narrowly passed the House and died in the Senate, where Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Richard Burr, R-N.C. sided with Democrats on a procedural vote to kill it.\n\nIn 2018, faced with a $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill, Trump backed down from a veto threat and reluctantly signed the bill, reasoning that it provided needed funds for the military.\n\nBIDEN SAYS $1.2T SPENDING PACKAGE IS \u2018GOOD NEWS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE,\u2019 BUT CONGRESS\u2019 WORK ISN\u2019T OVER\n\n\u201cI say to Congress, I will never sign another bill like this again,\u201d Trump said in remarks after he signed the bill.\n\nThe very next year, Trump signed a $1.4 trillion spending package to avert a partial government shutdown. He did so again as one of his last acts as president in December 2020, putting his signature on another massive $1.4 trillion omnibus that included $900 billion in COVID-19 aid.\n\nBut while Trump did not keep his promise to get federal spending under control in his first term, Biden is on track to exceed Trump\u2019s debt accumulation by the end of this year. In his first three years as president, Biden has added $6.75 trillion to the national debt, according to Treasury Department data. In his final year, the Congressional Budget Office projects a deficit of $1.58 trillion \u2014 which would total $8.3 trillion by the end of Biden\u2019s first term.\n\nThose estimates were made before Biden signed the new $1.2 trillion appropriations package on Saturday.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBiden\u2019s fiscal year 2025 budget calls for $3.3 trillion in net deficit reduction, although the revenue that is needed to achieve that goal would mostly come from tax increases. Biden has promised not to increase taxes on those making less than $400,000, but he otherwise has called for a repeal of Trump\u2019s tax cuts and additional taxes on corporations and the wealthy.\n\nTrump has campaigned on new rounds of tax cuts, arguing that economic growth stimulated by lower taxes will make up for any loss in government revenue. But he has yet to tell voters how he plans to cut spending, or how he will work with Congress to break the cycle of last-minute omnibus spending bills that were characteristic of his first term.\n\nOriginal News Source Link \u2013 Fox News\n\n\n\nRunning For Office?

            "text": "Mark Cuban of the Dallas Mavericks walks onto the court before a game against the Boston Celtics at the TD Garden on March 01, 2024 in Boston, Massachusetts. (Brian Fluharty/Getty Images)\n\n(DALLAS) \u2014 Billionaire businessman Mark Cuban, who voted for former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley in the 2024 GOP primary and is now supporting President Joe Biden, attended the president\u2019s second fundraiser in Dallas, Texas, on Wednesday night.\n\nBiden\u2019s appearance Wednesday night with Cuban, the former majority owner of the Dallas Mavericks, is part of the president\u2019s larger effort to court donors and supporters of Nikki Haley following her exit from the race.\n\nCuban is one of the main sharks of the ABC reality television series Shark Tank and will exit the show in 2025.\n\nHe confirmed his attendance late Wednesday night, telling ABC News he \u201cwanted to show my support and say hi to the President.\u201d\n\nAt the fundraiser in the backyard of a sprawling home in a wealthy Dallas neighborhood, Biden dug into his differences with former President Donald Trump and asked the iconic question coined by Ronald Reagan: \u201cAre you better off now than four years ago?\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me ask you \u2013 does anyone here want to go back to 2020? When fear ruled our lives and Trump was president? I don\u2019t think so,\u201d Biden said, calling on \u201cDemocrats, independents and Republicans,\u201d to join together to defeat Trump once again.\n\nA source familiar told ABC News the Biden campaign has also been hosting Zoom calls with former donors of Haley since she suspended her campaign on March 6.\n\nCuban, who says he cast his ballot in Texas for Haley, told Bloomberg earlier this month that he would vote for Biden over Trump.\n\nBiden\u2019s re-election campaign has said they are confident they\u2019ll be able to persuade Haley supporters who oppose a second Trump term to cross party lines and back the president in the fall.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump made it clear he doesn\u2019t want Nikki Haley\u2019s supporters. I want to be clear: There is a place for them in my campaign,\u201d Biden said in a statement minutes after Haley suspended her presidential campaign.\n\nThe Biden-Harris campaign has pointed to Haley still receiving a sizable share of votes in primary elections even after she dropped out of the race to argue Trump will have trouble uniting Republicans in November.\n\n\u201cNikki Haley is describing to the world exactly where and with whom Donald Trump is weak, and our campaign is paying attention to that and will be engaging voters very intentionally, to draw that contrast and invite them in,\u201d a campaign aide said on a press call Monday.\n\nAides point to exit polling as well to show there are Republican primary voters who say they would support Biden in the general election. In Ohio, for instance, as reported by ABC News, exit polling Tuesday found eight in 10 Haley supporters said they wouldn\u2019t vote for Trump in the general, with nearly half saying they\u2019d back Biden \u2014 a figure the Biden campaign blasted to reporters.\n\nAt least half a dozen former Haley bundlers have opted to help Biden\u2019s campaign rather than Trump\u2019s, according to reporting from CNBC that was distributed to reporters on Tuesday by Biden\u2019s team. Veteran media executive and former Haley donor Harry Sloan was one of those donors recruited to help reelect Biden and raise money for his campaign.\n\nCuban visited the White House earlier this month for a roundtable on lowering prescription drug costs, something Cuban is passionate about \u2014 he started Cost Plus Drug Company, which provides medication at low costs to consumers. Biden has touted his own efforts to tackle the high costs of prescription drugs \u2014 namely capping the cost of insulin at $35 for seniors.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024, ABC Audio.

But wages are rising, unemployment is negligible, the stock market is soaring, we somehow brushed off both the Trump presidency and the pandemic.\u201d\n\nAnd hey, you can see pictures of naked women pretty much whenever you want.\n\n\u201cYes, inflation persists for a lot of things, but an actual good, nice-sized TV now costs 60 bucks. Who gets credit for that? We\u2019ve got next-day shipping, stuffed-crust pizza, legal weed, GPS and porn on the phone. Cheer the f\u2013k up!\u201d he scolded.\n\n\u201cStop acting like life in America in 2024 is unbearable. Biden\u2019s ratings are in the toilet not because he\u2019s doing such a bad job but because a lot of Americans like to live with their head in the toilet!\u201d\n\nMaher occasionally likes to pretend he\u2019s a man of the people since he tours Middle America on a private jet, but his comedy shows involve him speaking to an audience that he doesn\u2019t have to listen to.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t have to reconcile the struggle of the average American who hasn\u2019t seen a raise in wages in years and dares not complain because his or her choice of employment is more limited than the seating on Maher\u2019s private jet.\n\nIf he truly understood what\u2019s going on, he wouldn\u2019t think most Americans\u2019 economic satisfaction is related to the stock market\u2019s success \u2014 when the top 1% of earners holds ownership of 54% of the stocks, valuing more than $19 trillion.\n\nMaher minimizes the impact of inflation as a side dish to our economic woes when it\u2019s really the main course.\n\nAnd it\u2019s worse than the official numbers show.\n\nKeep up with today's most important news Stay up on the very latest with Evening Update.

The DOJ specifically highlights the frequent consumer complaint of seeing a message sent from a non-iPhone device show up as green instead of the standard iMessage blue \u2014 and with fewer features than one sent between two iMessage users.\n\nIn a press conference Thursday following the release of the suit, Garland acknowledged Apple's dominance as a company \u2014 noting its market capitalization was larger than the GDP of more than 100 countries \u2014 but that this success was not the result of its superior products, but rather through its \"exclusionary\" tactics.\n\nApple's performance, he said, has come \"not by making its own products better, but by making other products worse.\"\n\nIn a statement, Apple denied the allegations and accused the government of overreach.\n\nIt said it was under no obligation to use designs or policies that may be preferred by competitors, especially when those designs would make iPhone users\u2019 experience worse.\n\nFor example, Apple said, it has not developed a version of iMessage compatible with non-iPhone devices because it would not be able to provide a comparable user experience that meets the company's standards.\n\n\u201cAt Apple, we innovate every day to make technology people love \u2014designing products that work seamlessly together, protect people\u2019s privacy and security, and create a magical experience for our users,\" it said. \"This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets. If successful, it would hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from Apple \u2014 where hardware, software, and services intersect. It would also set a dangerous precedent, empowering government to take a heavy hand in designing people\u2019s technology. We believe this lawsuit is wrong on the facts and the law, and we will vigorously defend against it.\u201d\n\nThe case is part of President Joe Biden\u2019s broader antitrust crackdown on Big Tech. The U.S. Justice Department is already suing Google for allegedly monopolizing digital advertising services, while the Federal Trade Commission has a long-running anti-monopoly case pending against Facebook parent Meta, as well as a more recent one against Amazon. And in December, the Federal Trade Commission sought to block Microsoft\u2019s now-closed acquisition of game maker Activision.\n\nThe suit against Apple represents the third attempt by an attorney general to go after the Cupertino, California-based tech behemoth \u2014 but the first to challenge Apple on such a broad basis.\n\n\u201cThis clearly escalates the Biden Administration antitrust efforts against Big Tech giants and adds to the current ongoing antitrust case against Google and other various cases against Meta and Amazon,\u201d Dan Ives, a managing director and senior equity research analyst at Wedbush Securities, said in an investor note.\n\nThe complaint goes on to allege that Apple\u2019s monopoly also extends to web browsers, video communication, news subscriptions, entertainment, automotive services, advertising, location services and more.\n\n\u201cFor years, Apple responded to competitive threats by imposing a series of \u2018Whac-A-Mole\u2019 contractual rules and restrictions that have allowed Apple to extract higher prices from consumers, impose higher fees on developers and creators, and to throttle competitive alternatives from rival technologies,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter of the Justice Department\u2019s Antitrust Division. \u201cToday\u2019s lawsuit seeks to hold Apple accountable and ensure it cannot deploy the same, unlawful playbook in other vital markets.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, the Chamber of Progress, a trade group funded by tech companies like Apple, criticized the suit.\n\n\u201cConsumers who buy iPhones like Apple\u2019s highly curated mobile ecosystem,\u201d said Chamber of Progress CEO Adam Kovacevich. \u201cThat\u2019s not an antitrust violation, that\u2019s why millions of people buy iPhones for security and ease of use. If DOJ forced Apple to open up its software and hardware, it would make iPhones more like Androids, depriving consumers of choice between two very different types of device.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, Apple was hit with a $2 billion fine by the European Union for restricting competition for music-streaming services in the app store. Apple said it would appeal.\n\nThe full lawsuit is below.",

            "text": "Joe Biden does not want to see gasoline prices rise before the elections. It would be detrimental to his chances of reelection if people were reminded about his failed energy policy.\n\nUkraine fights for its independence. Kyiv has been successful in attacking Russian oil refineries and hitting Russia right where it hurts the most: its wallet. This is one of the few weapons Ukraine has that can seriously affect Moscow\u2019s war-fighting capabilities.\n\nBiden cannot accept that. The administration has warned Ukraine repeatedly to leave the Russian refining facilities alone.\n\nThe Financial Times reported that \u201cwarnings were sent from Washington to senior officials of Ukraine\u2019s state intelligence service, SBU, and military intelligence directorate known as GUR.\u201d\n\nRussia is still one of the largest energy exporters in the world despite sanctions imposed by Western countries on its oil sector. Oil prices are up 15 percent this year to $85 per barrel. Fuel costs have increased just as US President Joe Biden launches his reelection campaign.\n\nWashington is also worried that if Ukraine continues to hit Russian facilities, many of which are located hundreds of miles away from the borderline, Russia may retaliate against the energy infrastructure that the West relies on.\n\nThe CPC pipeline, which carries oil from Kazakhstan to Russia and the world market, is included in this. ExxonMobil, Chevron, and other Western companies use this pipeline. It was briefly closed by Moscow in 2022.\n\nA spokesperson for the National Security Council stated, \u201cWe don\u2019t encourage or facilitate attacks in Russia.\u201d This is not true. Washington doesn\u2019t mind if Kyiv hits Russian military targets anywhere as long as Ukraine does not attack oil refineries.\n\nUnfortunately, Russia is also capable of playing this game.\n\nPolitico:\n\nOvernight, Russia launched an enormous barrage of drones and missiles against Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure, leaving many cities without power and damaging Dnipro Hydropower Plant, Ukraine\u2019s largest dam.\n\nUkraine\u2019s Energy Ministry said the attack had brought the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant to the brink of blackout. Since 2022, Russia has occupied the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe\u2019s largest.\n\nVolodymyr Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian president, said that more than 60 drones as well as almost 90 missiles were fired by Russia at Ukraine to target power plants and energy lines.\n\nKharkiv and Zaporizhzhia were without electricity for several hours. The biggest concern is the loss of power from the Dnipro Hydro plant. Losing that facility would result in a devastating environmental catastrophe and would also leave the Donetsk-Kryvyi Rih industrial region in darkness.\n\nUkrhydroenergo said that the Russians were attempting to create a \u201cnew ecological disaster\u201d by cynically attacking the hydroelectric plants and the dam.\n\nThe inability to strike back at Moscow\u2019s infrastructure for energy invites further destructive attacks such as this. It\u2019s not the U.S.\u2019s place to tell Ukraine how it should fight a conflict.",

Those payments are typically lower than under standard repayment, and can be zero under some plans.\n\nBorrowers typically get any remaining debt forgiven after 10, 20 or 25 years, depending on the plan.\n\nOne complicating factor for borrowers in these programs is that they often have multiple loans, taken out at different times, Kantrowitz said.\n\n\u201cThey get at least one new loan each year in school, on average,\u201d he said.\n\nThat can mean a borrower has multiple timelines to forgiveness, one for each of those loans.\n\nMore from Personal Finance:\n\nFAFSA fiasco may cause drop in college enrollment, experts say\n\nHarvard is back on top as the ultimate \u2018dream\u2019 school\n\nMore of the nation\u2019s top colleges roll out no-loan policies\n\nNow, the Biden administration is temporarily offering borrowers the chance to combine their loans and to get credit going back as far as their first loan payment on the oldest of their original loans in that bundle.\n\nFor example, say a borrower graduated from college in 2004, took out more loans for a graduate degree in 2018 and is now in repayment under an income-driven plan with a 20-year timeline to forgiveness. Consolidating could lead them to immediately qualify for forgiveness on all of those loans, experts say.\n\nIn normal times, consolidating your student loans can be a terrible move for those hoping to get rid of their debt as your forgiveness timeline is restarted. But the Biden administration has changed that program detail through April 30.\n\nWhat to know about consolidating your student loans\n\nAll federal student loans are eligible for consolidation, including Federal Family Education Loans, Parent Plus loans and Perkins Loans, Kantrowitz said.\n\nYou can apply for a Direct Consolidation Loan at StudentAid.gov or with your loan servicer.\n\n\u201cSo long as the application is submitted by April 30, they should be fine, even if the servicers takes longer to process it,\u201d Kantrowitz said.\n\nSome borrowers who took out small amounts may even be eligible for cancelation after as few as 10 years\u2019 worth of payments, if they enroll in the new income-driven repayment option, known as the SAVE plan.\n\nConsolidating your loans shouldn\u2019t increase your monthly payment, since your bill under an income-driven repayment plan is based on your earnings and not your total debt, Kantrowitz said.\n\nYour new interest rate will be a weighted average of the rates across your loans.\n\nBefore consolidating, it may be a good idea to get a complete payment history of each loan, so that you can later make sure you\u2019re getting the full credit you\u2019re entitled to, said Elaine Rubin, director of corporate communications at Edvisors, which helps students navigate college costs and borrowing.\n\nYou should be able to get a history of your payments at StudentAid.gov by looking into your loan details. You can also ask your servicer for a complete record.\n\nThe payment history counts when your loans first entered repayment, not when the loan was borrowed, Rubin said.\n\nIf a borrower believes there is an issue with their payment count, they can talk to their loan servicer or submit a complaint with the Department of Education\u2019s Federal Student Aid unit, she added.\n\nNews Related",

But the Biden-Harris campaign plans to highlight key moments from four years ago in an effort to flip the question back onto Trump, seeing a golden opportunity to exploit his handling of the pandemic.\n\nThe Biden campaign made a statement Friday morning highlighting Trump\u2019s pledge four years ago to the day to \u201cterminate\u201d the Affordable Care Act, roughly 10 days after the World Health Organization formally declared Covid-19 a global pandemic.\n\n\u201cFour years ago today, Trump was trying to throw millions of Americans off their insurance while Americans were dying by the thousands of Covid-19, even more Americans were infected, and hospitals were reaching a breaking point,\u201d Biden-Harris senior spokesperson Sarafina Chitika said in a statement.\n\nOn Thursday, the campaign released a digital ad that paired images from the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic with audio of Trump suggesting disinfectant as a treatment, downplaying concerns over the number of Covid-related deaths at the time and dismissing questions from reporters about his handling of the pandemic.\n\nAnd Biden is test-driving the strategy on the stump while speaking at fundraisers in Texas.\n\n\u201cJust a few days ago, he asked the famous question, are you better off today than you were yesterday? Well, Donald, I\u2019m glad you asked that question,\u201d Biden said during a campaign reception in Houston on Thursday. (The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nBiden pointed to Trump\u2019s handling of the pandemic and a debunked claim that Trump suggested the injection of bleach as a treatment option.\n\n\u201cHe must\u2019ve done it,\u201d Biden joked.\n\nIt comes amid a broader effort by Biden and his campaign to co-opt language made popular by Trump and Republicans.\n\nIn a bid to highlight that Biden held more campaign events this month than Trump, Biden\u2019s campaign accused the former president of \u201chiding in his basement\u201d \u2014 a line Trump and allies frequently deployed about Biden in 2020.\n\nThe campaign has also turned \u201cBrandon\u201d \u2014 a code word used by Republicans to insult Biden \u2014 into a kind of internet alter-ego and a core component of his social media branding, launching a \u201cDark Brandon\u201d account on X and releasing several \u201cDark Brandon\u201d-branded memes.\n\nA senior Biden-Harris campaign official told NBC News the campaign will continue to highlight \u201ckey moments from four years ago throughout the month of April.\u201d\n\nThose moments will include headlines reminding voters of rising crime and toilet paper shortages toward the end of Trump\u2019s first term and footage reminding voters of the \u201cchaos\u201d of the pandemic in 2020.\n\n\u201cAmericans remember March Madness, proms, weddings, and celebrations being canceled, waiting in line for toilet paper and essentials, businesses shutting down, and losing loved ones \u2014 all because Trump failed to prepare for and then couldn\u2019t lead when we needed him the most,\u201d \u201cThe only thing to happen four years ago to make Americans\u2019 lives better was Donald Trump losing to Joe Biden,\u201d Biden campaign spokesperson Ammar Moussa said.",

Receive daily email alerts, subscriber notes & personalize your experience. Register Now\n\nThe votes were part of what Republicans dubbed \"Energy Week\" and advanced measures to roll back the US Environmental Protection Agency's Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and scrap the EPA's new fee on oil and gas methane emissions. Another measure would also streamline water crossing permits for oil and gas pipelines and other linear infrastructure.\n\nAlthough the bills stand almost no chance of passage by the Democrat-controlled Senate, they could indicate what GOP lawmakers try to enact if Republicans win both chambers of Congress and the White House this November. And they present another chance for Republican lawmakers to air grievances with Biden administration energy policies.\n\n\"Biden's policies have discouraged private investment in traditional energy projects and harmed American consumers by things such as killing the Keystone Pipeline,\" said Representative Michael Burgess, Republican-Texas, vice chair of the House Rules Committee March 19. \"House Republicans believe that there is a different path, one that lowers energy costs and secures energy independence, and in fact benefits all Americans.\"\n\nDemocrats, for their part, emphasized that domestic energy production has hit all-time highs despite the GOP attacks on Biden's approach. They accused Republicans of passing repeated messaging bills, seeking to gut pollution prevention programs, and offering more handouts to the oil and gas sector.\n\nThe House voted to repeal the EPA's $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and rescind any unobligated balances for the program. The fund, created through the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, provides grants, including to low-income and disadvantaged communities, for projects to cut greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution.\n\nUnder GOP control, the House has voted several times in the past year to reverse the program, but that effort has never advanced in the Senate.\n\nThe House also passed H.R. 7023, the Creating Confidence in Clean Water Permitting Act, which among other things would require the US Army Corps of Engineers to maintain general water crossing permits on a nationwide basis for linear infrastructure projects.\n\nTo avoid getting bogged down in a more extensive Clean Water Act permitting process for large projects with multiple water crossings, oil and gas pipeline developers have preferred use of a general permit known as Nationwide Permit 12.\n\nAfter halting the Keystone XL Pipeline approval in a January 2021 executive order, the Biden Administration has held the general permit under review, a status that oil pipeline developers argue creates uncertainty.\n\nDemocrats contend the bill would weaken the Clean Water Act and the Environmental Protection Agency's ability to enforce laws against polluters.\n\nInterstate gas pipeline have recently emphasized that they believe reform of the Clean Water Section 401 process, not included in the bill, would be necessary to make real progress on permitting reform. Gas pipelines developers have long complained that some states were abusing their veto power under Section 401.\n\nSignals for production\n\nThe House also passed a bill to withdraw a July 2023 proposal from the US Bureau of Land Management to raise royalty rates and make other changes to the federal oil and gas leasing program for public lands.\n\nHouse Republicans also approved non-binding \"sense of Congress\" resolutions stating that the president cannot declare a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing without approval from Congress and that a carbon tax would hurt the US economy.\n\nThe bills are part of House Republicans' efforts to reverse major climate and energy policies from the Biden administration and Democratic lawmakers, including key IRA programs and tax incentives supporting zero-carbon technologies.\n\nHouse Democrats blasted the GOP \"Energy Week,\" calling it a \"shameless political stunt for [House Republicans'] fossil fuel supporters,\" according to leaders of the House Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition.\n\nRepublicans in the House \"want nothing less than to roll back the historic clean energy investments that are already driving a boom in domestic manufacturing, slashing pollution, and creating thousands of jobs across America,\" coalition members said in a March 19 statement.",

            "text": "A coalition of 16 Republican states, led by Texas and Louisiana, filed a lawsuit against the Biden administration, challenging its recent climate action pausing proposed energy projects.\n\nThe multistate coalition filed its complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana, listing President Biden, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm and the Department of Energy (DOE) among the defendants in the case. According to the complaint, the DOE\u2019s move earlier this year pausing major liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminal projects violated long-standing federal energy laws.\n\n\u201cBiden\u2019s unilateral decree disregards statutory mandates, flouts the legal process, upends the oil and gas industry, disrupts the Texas economy, and subverts our constitutional structure,\u201d said Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton.\n\n\u201cThe ban will drive billions of dollars in investment away from Texas, hinder our ability to maximize revenue for public schools, force Texas producers to flare excess natural gas instead of taking it to market, and annihilate critical jobs,\u201d he continued. \u201cI will not stand by while Biden attacks Texas.\u201d\n\nGOP LEADERS CONFRONT BIDEN\u2019S NEW CLIMATE CZAR ON KEY SECURITY RISKS LURKING IN GREEN AGENDA\n\nAccording to Paxton, the LNG export moratorium is unconstitutional, ignores the 1938 Natural Gas Act\u2019s \u201cpresumption in favor of exports\u201d and discards decades of DOE energy policy.\n\nIn arguing the alleged unconstitutionality of the policy, the states\u2019 complaint notes Article I of the Constitution vests Congress with \u201c[a]ll legislative Powers,\u201d including the power \u201c[t]o regulate Commerce with foreign Nations.\u201d Therefore, since blocking LNG exports can be considered a regulation of commerce, the DOE violated the Constitution, according to the lawsuit.\n\nTIKTOK ACTIVIST SAYS HE ADVISED WHITE HOUSE ON BIDEN\u2019S NEW NATURAL GAS MORATORIUM\n\n\u201cThe LNG Export Ban implicates an issue of profound national importance. LNG exports account for billions of dollars to the economy and thousands of jobs,\u201d the complaint states. \u201cThey also raise serious questions of national security. And this is an issue that has been the subject of proposed legislation and public attention in and outside of Congress.\u201d\n\nThe complaint accuses DOE of violating the Administrative Procedure Act which governs the procedures of administrative law. The states highlight that DOE failed to host any public comment period before finalizing its LNG policy without \u201cgood cause to forego the notice and comment requirement.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, the states argue the DOE failed to properly consider the Natural Gas Act and its provision that states the agency issue an export license before hearing from the public.\n\nDOZENS OF FORMER TOP FEDERAL OFFICIALS CALL ON CONGRESS TO STRIKE DOWN BIDEN\u2019S NATURAL GAS CRACKDOWN\n\n\u201cThe Biden administration\u2019s illegal attacks on American energy jeopardizes the livelihoods of thousands of hard-working Louisiana men and women, millions of dollars in tax revenue, and billions of dollars in infrastructure,\u201d said Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill.\n\n\u201cLNG continues to have an enormous positive economic impact for our state \u2014 especially on our hard-hit coastal communities, which continue to recover from a recent series of devastating hurricanes. Jobs like these grow the economy, reduce crime, and help address the out-migration problem,\u201d she continued. \u201cThe people of Louisiana are proud to power this nation. I\u2019m ready to fight for them.\u201d\n\nIn a surprise move in January, Biden ordered the DOE to pause pending permits for LNG export facilities while federal officials conduct a rigorous environmental review assessing the projects\u2019 carbon emissions, which could take more than a year to complete. The action was lauded by climate activists who have loudly called for such a move, which they said would help combat global warming.\n\nHowever, the move was blasted by industry groups, former federal officials and bipartisan lawmakers, who noted energy exports are vital for aiding allies in Europe and Asia. In the aftermath of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine two years ago, U.S. LNG largely filled the void left by Russian natural gas as U.S. allies sought to wean off Russian exports and punish the nation\u2019s economy, a plan Biden endorsed at the time.\n\nOpponents also argued that LNG exports bolster domestic energy production and boost the U.S. economy. Fossil fuel industry groups recently cited research indicating that LNG exports could add as much as $73 billion to the U.S. economy by 2040, create 453,000 American jobs and increase U.S. purchasing power by $30 billion.",

            "text": "The open borders crowd is on a mission to shove immigrants (legal or not) down our throats. With sensational murders like that of Laken Riley, they seek to get in front of the problem and claim that immigrants have lower crime rates than native born Americans [Immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than U.S.-born Americans, studies find,by Jasmin Garsd, NPR, March 22, 2024]. I should hope so. If you are in a foreign country, afraid of being deported, I would think that you would be on your best behavior. Ann Coulter recently had an article about \u201cThe Myth of Low Immigrant Crime\u201d. Apparently, much of the \u201cstudies\u201d about immigrants having a low crime rate are all studies done by one Alex Nowrasteh [Tweet him] of the open borders libertarian Cato Institute (I thought Cato was Inspector Clouseau\u2019s Chinese manservant. Seems appropriate for a joke of a thinktank).\n\nAlso, with Joe Biden\u2019s SOTU speech in which he engaged in \u201cwhataboutism\u201d trying to diminish Laken Riley\u2019s murder by an illegal alien by saying \"How many of the thousands of people are being killed by legals?\u201d. It\u2019s typical liberal where a murder happens and they say, \u201cWell, there are plenty of Americans who commit murder too.\u201d The thing is that we have to deal with our fellow citizens which is bad enough, now, we have to import murderers too?\n\nAnyway, as far as those legally here committing crime, I tried finding the statistics on how many green cards get revoked because of immigrants committing crime. From my past, I can remember one Iraqi who had his LAPR status revoked (Lawfully Approved for Permanent Residency aka Green Card) because of a conviction for distributing cocaine. Yet, he wasn\u2019t deported because he claimed he would be killed if he was sent back to Iraq. (Gee, maybe you shouldn\u2019t have broken the law here then. Did you think of that?)\n\nIn 2018, 26% of federal prisoners were aliens, according to the Center For Immigration Studies. That doesn\u2019t count all the aliens imprisoned at the state and local level. Here\u2019s a breakdown of which countries they come from, courtesy of the Federal Bureau Of Prisons.\n\nHowever, I don\u2019t think this paints the full picture. I can remember talking to a Turkish guy many years ago. He was a graduate student, and he was telling me that several of his fellow Turkish students here in the United States were taking out credit cards are racking up tremendous bills because upon graduation, they intended to leave the United States and never come back.\n\nI once briefly served on a Border Enforcement Security Team (BEST) where ICE investigated all kinds of crimes, mainly drug importation. As you can imagine, just about every single narcotics violation had an immigrant connection. We don\u2019t grow cocaine here after all.\n\nIn my experience arresting run of the mill illegal aliens, a great many had prior arrests, but no convictions. They would get charged with DUIs, marijuana possession, assault (either domestic or a drunken fight with amigos), trespassing etc.\u2026 Low level crimes in general, and rather than stick around for trial, they simply moved to a different state. Most jurisdictions will not bother to extradite for low level crimes, so, they never showed a conviction. This posed a problem for us when Obama came into office, because his administration said that illegal aliens who had committed no crime were not a priority for deportation. So, an illegal alien who had been arrested for DUI three times, but showed no convictions would often get walked out the door.\n\nAnother time, one of my friends was investigating Romanians coming to the United States to pull off scams. They would get on eBay, advertise a high end luxury Mercedes for sale. When someone bit on their offer, they would have the unsuspecting American wire them $500 to show their good faith. After doing this at an address in one state, they would quickly change states and do the same thing in another state. They were sending back to Romania over a million dollars pulling this scam. They would rotate out players in this fraud back and forth from Romania. They had no ties to America after all.\n\nI also remember years back hearing about Colombian shoplifting rings operating in the United States. If any of them got caught here in the U.S., they would post bond and flee back to Colombia to be replaced by another Colombian.\n\nHere are some recent headlines about foreigners committing scams in the U.S.\n\nLuxury home burglary wave: LAPD, Scottsdale police intensify efforts against organized South American gangs, by: Eddie Killian, Law Enforcement Today, March 19, 2024\n\nSouth American gangs targeting upscale residences with Chileans, Peruvians, Ecuadorians, and Colombians all operating as one big happy family.\n\nGypsy Family Arrested in $3M Tech Theft Ring ,com, March 19, 2013\n\nThis is an old one\u2014referenced because easy to find only because KTLA put \u201cGypsy Family in the headline\u2014involving Roma Gypsies, but, in my experience, Roma Gypsies are involved in a lot of crime. If caught, many of them would post bond, flee back to Romania, obtain a new ID there, then go to Canada and sneak back across the border into America.\n\nMaryland thieves connected to theft ring from South America, in US illegally: ICE, by Greg Wehner, Fox News, March 17, 2024\n\nHere\u2019s another theft ring that was operating in Baltimore County originating in Chile. It looks like the majority of the culprits were visa overstays (came in legally on a visa, but didn\u2019t leave when the terms of the visa expired).\n\nNY arrests 41 connected to $3.5M retail theft ring, by Morgan McKay, Fox5NY, May 27, 2022\n\nHere\u2019s one shoplifting ring headed by one Roni Rubinov, \u201cQueensman\u201d. They seem to ignore his immigration status, but here\u2019s the list of those indicted along with him and you tell me if you think there\u2019s an immigration angle to this.\n\nHere are the first 15 names\n\nHere\u2019s a recent one involving \u201cretail theft\u201d (shoplifting) involving poor oppressed immigrants.\n\nForeign-run organized theft rings ravaging US retail stores with immigrant shoplifters: FBI, by Anna Giaritelli, Washington Examiner, December 12, 2023\n\nHere\u2019s an overview of South American and Eastern Europeans coming to America to \u201csteal and then ship goods internationally.\u201d\n\nIf prices are up at your local store, it\u2019s not just because of government spending. Immigrant crime plays a significant role.\n\nI remember a professor in college telling us about a study involving two poor communities, one with a high crime rate, the other with a low one. The researchers found that the big difference between the two communities was transiency. In the high crime neighborhood, there were a lot of renters who were constantly moving in and out. In the low crime neighborhood, residents had lived there for generations and almost all knew each other. In this latter neighborhood, they looked out for each other and knew who belonged to which house. In the other neighborhood, people didn\u2019t want to get involved in other people\u2019s business and they didn\u2019t know each other.\n\nAs we let in thousands of people with little to no ties to the United States, they will happily move about the country committing crimes and hopping to a new jurisdiction, or, simply return to their home countries.\n\nP.S. Our government tries to hide immigrant crime. It\u2019s difficult to find out statistics on things like how many Green Cards are revoked due to criminal convictions. I can remember touring one of the Federal Detention Facilities. There were literally thousands of immigrants there waiting to see if they would be deported. They had a law library for doing research.\n\nIn my anecdotal experience, a lot of immigrants feel no loyalty to the U.S., but just look on us as a land to be plundered.",

On a per-person basis, the forgiveness amounts to about $77,000 per person.\n\nEver since the Supreme Court last year invalidated the Biden administration's plan for broad-based student loan forgiveness, the Biden administration has sought to rely on existing and new loan repayment plans to provide debt relief to almost 4 million people. Americans are carrying about $1.77 trillion in student debt, a financial burden that some college grads say has made it tougher to achieve financial milestones like buying a home.\n\nThe Biden administration has sought to fix problems in the nation's student loan repayment system by rolling out a new program called SAVE and making it easier for public servants to get their debt erased.\n\n\"For too long, our nation's teachers, nurses, social workers, firefighters and other public servants faced logistical troubles and trapdoors when they tried to access the debt relief they were entitled to under the law,\" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. \"With this announcement, the Biden-Harris Administration is showing how we're taking further steps not only to fix those trapdoors, but also to expand opportunity to many more Americans.\"\n\nWho qualifies for student loan forgiveness?\n\nThe Biden administration said 77,700 borrowers who are enrolled in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program will receive debt forgiveness.\n\nThose who are receiving debt forgiveness include public servants who enrolled in the Biden administration's limited PSLF waiver, which allows public sector workers who haven't previously qualified for loan relief to receive credit for past repayments, the administration said.\n\nWhat were the prior problems with the PSLF program?\n\nThe PSLF program, which has been around since 2007, had the lofty goal of forgiving the student debt of Americans who work in public sector jobs, such as teachers or government employees, for at least 10 years.\n\nBut its notoriously Byzantine regulations and misleading guidance from some loan-servicing companies meant that few public servants managed to get debt relief. In fact, only 7,000 people received forgiveness through the PSLF prior to the Biden administration.\n\nSince the White House made changes to PSLF, about 871,000 Americans have received student loan forgiveness through the program, the Biden administration said.\n\nHow will I know if I got PSLF debt forgiveness?\n\nThe 77,700 borrowers who qualify will receive a letter from President Biden next week congratulating them on their relief.\n\nI'm enrolled in PSLF. Will I get loan forgiveness, too?\n\nAnother 380,000 people enrolled in PSLF will receive an email from Biden next week letting them know they are within one to two years of qualifying for debt forgiveness through the program.\n\nAccording to a sample email, Biden will congratulate them and urge them to continue working in public service to qualify for forgiveness.

            "text": "Earlier today, the Biden administration unveiled a significant new rule to catalyze the electric vehicle industry in the United States and reduce future sales of new gas-powered cars.\n\nContrary to some misconceptions, the rule does not ban gas cars or mandate electric vehicle sales. Instead, it introduces a new emissions standard, compelling automakers to slash their fleets\u2019 average carbon emissions by nearly 50 percent by 2032.\n\nThe implementation of this rule is anticipated to expedite the automotive industry\u2019s transformation. Automakers will likely respond by increasing the proportion of electric and hybrid models in their fleets.\n\nAs a result, the Biden administration estimates that electric vehicles could constitute up to half of all new car sales by 2032. Additionally, this initiative aligns with the administration\u2019s ambitious goal of halving U.S. emissions by 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.\n\nHowever, the final rule represents a moderated version of a proposal introduced last spring, incorporating concessions to the United Autoworkers Union that afford car companies greater flexibility during the initial three years after its implementation in 2027.\n\nIt\u2019s important to recognize that tailpipe emissions pose a threat to the climate and public health. Inhaling pollutants emitted from car tailpipes is a significant health hazard, resulting in tens of thousands of premature deaths annually in the U.S.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that the new rule will significantly reduce harmful air pollution, yielding approximately $13 billion in annual health benefits.\n\nThis rule arrives amid attempts by Republicans to politicize electric vehicles as a hallmark of President Biden\u2019s climate agenda. Former President Donald Trump, in particular, has vehemently opposed electric vehicles, recently using strong language to criticize them.\n\nIt\u2019s anticipated that Trump and other opponents will seize the Biden administration\u2019s new rule to amplify their opposition to electric vehicles. Consequently, the types of cars Americans will be driving eight years from now could emerge as a central climate-related issue in the upcoming presidential election.",

The findings revealed that the share of people with no strong opinion on whether they trust information from scientists and scientific bodies plummeted from 75% to 29%.\n\nThis indicated that people had migrated to either end of the continuum in terms of their trust in scientific expertise. The pool expressing low or very low trust in scientific expertise grew from 2% to 13%, while those holding science in high or very high regard jumped from 22% to 57%. These shifts occurred regardless of political affiliation.\n\nThe likely cause of the shifts was the COVID-19 pandemic, as respondents were aware of the Trump administration\u2019s criticism of public health authorities like Anthony Fauci. Despite this, people were desperate to find reliable information about the pandemic, leading to an increase in mistrust but an even greater increase in trust.\n\nPolling Americans on their views about science is challenging as it is not a salient issue for many. Many Americans may have never met a scientist or understand what scientists do. As a result, researchers use questions about the sources of scientific information that people find trustworthy.\n\nNCSE\u2019s Branch found the results of the study encouraging, noting that while the Trump administration had an impact on trust in science, it did not break it entirely.",

Lighthizer; Linda McMahon, who headed the Small company Administration under Trump; and Kash Patel, who served on Trump\u2019s National Security Council.\n\nHowever lockups are basic arrangements in business offers and extremely seldom reversed, according to 3 SPAC specialists who consulted with The Washington Post. Huge financiers and financial investment lenders, they stated, typically demand the arrangements due to the fact that they provide financiers self-confidence that significant investors will not try to find an early exit and perhaps drive down the cost.\n\nIf Trump or other investors were offered a lockup waiver, other financiers may be worried that they might \u201cflood the marketplace due to the fact that they have many shares\u201d or seem \u201csquandering to leave the business due to the fact that they do not believe well of its potential customers,\u201d stated Usha Rodrigues, a University of Georgia law teacher who studies SPACs.\n\nIf the share cost plunged after Trump got a lockup waiver, the relocation might likewise open the business to investor claims arguing it had actually unjustly harmed their monetary stake, stated Michael Ohlrogge, a New york city University associate law teacher.\n\n\u201d Due to the fact that of this huge liability danger, I have a tough time picturing a business approving a lockup waiver,\u201d Ohlrogge stated. \u201cIt might quickly have an incredibly big, unfavorable influence on the share cost. At the exact same time, even if doing this made the cost fall by 90 percent, the entire offer would still wind up being very profitable for\u201d Trump.\n\nThe post-merger business will maintain the Trump Media name and be led by Devin Nunes, the previous Republican politician agent from California. The business might start trading on the Nasdaq stock market as quickly as Monday under the ticker sign of Trump\u2019s initials, DJT. That sign was likewise utilized for Trump\u2019s just other public business, Trump Hotels and Gambling Establishment Resorts, which collapsed into a cent stock in less than a years and applied for personal bankruptcy in 2004.\n\nReality Social has actually ended up being Trump\u2019s primary online loudspeaker and a meeting place for Trump advocates.

The proposition went no place, though the 2 guys have actually interacted considering that.\n\nMore just recently, the offer has actually been involved in a legal fight royale, with 4 claims in 3 states including Trump Media, Digital World, co-founders Andy Litinsky and Wes Moss, and Digital World\u2019s previous president, Patrick Orlando.\n\nOrlando\u2013 who was fired as chief in 2015 however stays in control of Digital World\u2019s greatest starting financier, Arc Global Investments II\u2013 had actually declined to enact assistance of the merger before Friday\u2019s vote, possibly threatening the offer, lawyers for Trump Media and Digital World stated in a suit today looking for to require his vote. Orlando spoke just quickly on the investor call Friday and did not provide additional discuss how he voted.\n\nDigital World\u2019s more than 400,000 retail financiers consisted of advocates of Trump and speculators wanting to capitalize the offer\u2019s attention. One financier, worn a pirate outfit and calling himself \u201cCaptain DWAC,\u201d live-streamed the investor vote on the video website Rumble and played noises of applause when the effective vote was revealed.",

            "text": "Former president Donald Trump holds a rally to encourage the audience to vote in the primaries.\n\nSnipers on the roof watched through binoculars as long lines of people snaked inside the doors of the Coliseum and through security. People chatted and chanted among themselves about the state of the world and its affairs, many with differing opinions and life experiences\u2013but they were all there for the same reason\u2013to see former President Donald Trump.\n\nIn a sea of red hats and signs, he held his second rally in the Winthrop Coliseum on Feb. 23, the day before the Republican primary began. He took the stage around 4:15 p.m., following comments from Marjorie Taylor Green and Tim Scott, among others. He was guarded by secret service men and bulletproof glass.\n\nAs the audience waited, his campaign played \u201cJustice for All\u201d over the speakers, a rendition of the United States Pledge of Allegiance featuring Trump and the J6 Prison Choir, which was released on streaming platforms back in March of last year.\n\nHe was introduced by Gov. Henry McMaster, who said \u201cThis is what we really, really, want\u2013we want someone who will protect our borders, return illegals and build a wall! We want a man who will get the \u2018woke\u2019 out of the military and put the fight back in! We want to put judges in the courts to protect the Constitution and enforce the law, and we want a man who will show our enemies abroad that America is standing back up, and it\u2019s time for them to sit back down!\u201d\n\nTrump started by saying that the last time he was in the Coliseum was in January 2016 shortly before he took office; thus, he called the venue \u201clucky.\u201d Trump also made remarks about the border, saying, \u201cThe border is having problems, they\u2019ve got rapists, they\u2019ve got thugs. What we have now is a total disaster.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe addressed his supporters, saying, \u201cI am glad to be back in South Carolina with thousands of hardworking God God-fearing American patriots,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nRespondents in the Winthrop Poll found that 46% of S.C.\u2019s registered voters don\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t support a move by the federal government to declare the U.S. a Christian nation, but the majority of Republicans\u201355%\u2013would support them doing so.\n\nHe continued by saying he wasn\u2019t worried about the primary results, and instead encouraged attendees to get out and vote in the presidential election on Nov. 5. \u201cGotta beat Crooked Joe Biden\u2013if it\u2019s going to be him, I don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll make it to the starting gate\u2013Henry (McMaster) would know.\u201d\n\nHe also said that he thinks the \u201cUltra Left\u201d will attempt to rig the Primary results in their favor, and criticized Democrats who vote in the Republican Primary.\n\n\u201cTogether we built the greatest economy in the history of the world\u2013it was the greatest economy in history, nobody\u2019s ever seen anything like it\u2013with the biggest tax cuts ever recorded\u2013bigger than Ronald Reagan\u2013and we like Ronald Reagan, but we beat him out on the tax cuts, the biggest regulation cuts, record energy production like never before and rising wages for Americans of every race, religion, color and creed. We never did so well.\u201d\n\nGas prices have been at their highest since COVID. With this, Trump compared his presidential term with Biden\u2019s in regards to inflation. \u201cUnder Biden gas prices have reached five, six and even seven dollars a gallon.\u2019\u2019 He said that under his leadership, gas prices were \u201cunder $1.87 a gallon.\u2019\u2019\n\nAccording to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the average nationwide gas price per gallon for all types was $1.87 in February 2016, but steadily increased again in the following months, hovering around $2.50 a gallon. In January 2021, the national average was $2.42, and the price has spiked, reaching its peak in June 2022 at $5.32 a gallon.\n\nTrump blames the high mortgage rates on the results of the 2020 election Joe Biden winning, which he thinks was rigged. He said the upcoming election could be a \u201cfailed\u2019\u2019 or \u201crigged election.\u2019\u2019 According to Trump, wars would not have taken place during his presidential term. \u201cWhat they did in 2020 is disgraceful and look what happened to our country, you have wars that would have never taken place, Russia would have never attacked Ukraine, Israel would not have been attacked, you would not have inflation.\u2019\u2019\n\nDuring the same time Trump was giving his speech, a student organization group called Students for Justice or SFORJ held a rally outside in protest of the ongoing events in Palestine and the Gaza strip. Their group advocates against the ongoing conflict in Sudan, the Congo and other oppressed countries.\n\nTrump said that if he were elected president again, he already knows what\u2019s at the top of his agenda. \u201cUpon taking office I will end Joe Biden\u2019s war on American energy, cancel his ban on exporting American natural gas, and we will quite simply drill.\u2019\u2019\n\nAccording to a Winthrop University press release on the Winthrop Poll, \u201cAmong Independents who are likely to vote in the upcoming primary, 42.3% support Haley while 42.6% support Trump. Among GOP voters only, Trump maintains a stronghold at 72%.\u2019\u2019\n\nTrump won the S.C. Primary vote the following day with about 59.8% of votes compared to Haley, who had 39.5%. Trump said that Nikki Haley \u201cis essentially a democrat\u2019\u2019 because she receives funding from Democratic companies, and Republicans do not like her policies. After she lost the Primary, a Libertarian conservative organization called Americans for Prosperity\u2013owned by the Koch brothers,\u2013discontinued sending funds to Haley\u2019s campaign.\n\nAs Trump wraps up his rally, he speaks again on the things he previously mentioned that are going on in the world and that these things would not happen under the Trump administration. \u201cI will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled, people dying by the thousands. Under the Trump administration we will return to peace and strength, they respected us all over the world. Three years ago we had the most secure border in U.S history.\u201d\n\nVoting for the presidential election will begin November 5. In the state of South Carolina, you must be registered 30 days before voting begins. For more information, visit Winthrop\u2019s frequently asked questions about voting.",

            "text": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nAlthough many Americans and policy wonks see climate change as the major existential issue of our time, it ends up feeling like a relatively small piece of the American political conversation, which is more focused on the economy, immigration and democracy.\n\nThe climate crisis ends up touching on all of those issues, as CNN\u2019s chief climate correspondent Bill Weir told me. His new book, \u201cLife As We Know It (Can Be): Stories of People, Climate and Hope in a Changing World,\u201d comes out on April 16. We talked on the phone about his recent trip to Massachusetts, where some beachfront homeowners who want the state to do more to help protect the area from erosion and rising sea levels also deny the climate is in crisis.\n\nMy conversation with Weir, edited for clarity, is below:\n\nThe depressing reality vs. the promise of innovation\n\nWOLF: You\u2019re on the ground covering the climate crisis every day. Where has that taken you recently?\n\nWEIR: To both ends of the spectrum. It\u2019s the grim reality of what\u2019s unfolding and also, we\u2019re working on a special on innovation.\n\nMost recently, I was in Salisbury, Massachusetts, on the New Hampshire border where folks there, over the generations, have watched the high tide get higher, year by year. As is the case along the Atlantic coast, erosion is accelerating along with sea level rise.\n\nAnd so this year, over 100 homeowners banded together, spent $600,000 on 15,000 tons of sand in order to fortify their beachside homes from storms and higher tides. In years past, that would last them three or four years, but then they got yet another freak storm and high tide and most of it was washed away in a single day.\n\nThey\u2019re coming to grips in various forms with the five stages of climate grief. They very much want the state to kick in.\n\nI met some neighbors who refuse to acknowledge climate science and just believe that this is a string of bad luck, a one-off series of unfortunate events. Others are coming around to the to the idea and the actual scientific warnings that Massachusetts is bracing for, officially, a couple of feet of sea level rise above year 2000 levels just in the next decade or two.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback This $600k defense against sea level rise could have lasted 3 years. It was destroyed in less than a day 03:02 - Source: CNN\n\nThis was a fascinating case study in the psychology about it, and how people who don\u2019t really acknowledge the warnings of science are the ones most dedicated to saving what\u2019s there now, and so are a vital part of bracing for what\u2019s unfolding.\n\nAnd at the other end of the spectrum?\n\nWEIR: I went down to Florida and met with a couple of inspirational developers. One is Syd Kitson, a former NFL player, who built the first solar power town in America. It\u2019s called Babcock Ranch, Florida.\n\nI was riding out Hurricane Ian a few miles away where everything was plunged into darkness and flooded. But because of his designs and ideas, they never lost power and never flooded, and as a result, the demand for people to buy homes in Babcock Ranch has skyrocketed. He\u2019s building them as fast as he can.\n\nAnd so I\u2019m looking at glimpses into how the climate crisis is already changing neighborhoods and which direction we\u2019re likely to go when it comes to construction and food supplies and energy. It\u2019s all changing incredibly fast \u2013 an industrial revolution that nobody\u2019s talking about.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback See why this Florida town survived Ian unscathed 03:40 - Source: CNN\n\nClimate refugees from Puerto Rico to Buffalo\n\nWOLF: You did another story recently about Buffalo as a landing spot for climate refugees. I think it\u2019s interesting that on the one hand, you\u2019re talking to people who are making it so that we can withstand climate change in Florida, but then also thinking about where people are eventually going to have to move because of climate change. How far out is the horizon where we actually see people moving away from the Sunbelt because that\u2019s where people have been moving to for so long?\n\nVideo Ad Feedback This city rarely reaches 100 degrees. It is now considered a 'climate refuge' 03:36 - Source: CNN\n\nWEIR: It\u2019s a fascinating question for different reasons. Five thousand people who were driven out of Puerto Rico by Hurricane Maria went to Buffalo for refuge because there\u2019s a Puerto Rican community there; 3,000 of them stayed.\n\nThe city embraced that. They need folks to revitalize these Rust Belt towns, and they have a ton of fresh water and clean energy with Niagara Falls. So they\u2019ve declared themselves a climate refuge. For them, it\u2019s not just the latitude, it\u2019s the attitude around migration.\n\nAt the same time, for the first time in human history, sun and wind energy are the cheapest forms of energy. And so the sun belts, now we\u2019re gonna think of them as the solar belts, and the wind belts, the high plains of Texas, are going to be a huge magnet for big manufacturing who need a lot of abundant energy.\n\nTexas now leads the nation in clean energy just because of the economics, despite the politics and ideology. Bright-red Texas is the greenest state right now. The math, the economics of it, is going to change the landscape of what attracts companies, and then as a result, what attracts workers.\n\nBut ultimately, the heat is going to win. As the belly on the planet becomes more intolerable, the northern latitudes become that much more attractive.\n\nAlaska could be the new Florida for retirees. It\u2019ll be a lot wetter up there. But the band of the United States from Portland, Maine, to Portland, Oregon, across the Great Lakes is a refuge that is best positioned for that.\n\nThe UN predicts tens of millions of folks forced to cross borders by sudden, unnatural disasters. You can see what\u2019s happening on the border now. And as droughts get worse in Central America, you can just play it out. The strain is going to go up.\n\nRemoving politics from climate change\n\nWOLF: It\u2019s interesting to hear you say that about Texas, because the governor and the Republican-dominated legislature there would seemingly be opposed to doing anything specifically because of climate change. But if there\u2019s a capitalist urge, people seem more in tune with it. Joe Biden has tried to make the argument that addressing climate change should be an economic boom. Do you think that even if people are unwilling to accept that climate change is happening, they still might be doing things to address it?\n\nWEIR: Oh, absolutely. A story that I don\u2019t get to tell enough is just this massive boom in renewables and clean energy and clean water tech.\n\nI think the most recent analysis was for every dollar spent by the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act, five-and-a-half bucks in private investment has chased that.\n\nAnd there are these massive growth rates in the sectors that people aren\u2019t talking about \u2013 carbon removal, thermal storage, using big boxes of hot rocks to store clean energy, using the earth as a battery through pressure, geothermal \u2013 all of these things are exploding now.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Scientists have a way of removing carbon dioxide from our oceans 02:37 - Source: CNN\n\nAt the same time, the United States is the biggest petrostate in human history. Joe Biden has exported much more fossil fuels than Donald Trump. It\u2019s the result of this big boom in fracked natural gas. That\u2019s a big sticking point with the environmental wing of his base.\n\nThe big question is how much this new energy boom replaces the old, dirty kind of energy or if we just are so ravenous in our appetites; humanity never cuts back.\n\nIn places like Charleston (South Carolina), where they\u2019re building a billion dollar seawall, and people are raising their 100-year-old mansions on the Battery, it\u2019s not a political debate. It is reality. The physics are right there in your face.\n\nMatt Yglesias is among others who have said we shouldn\u2019t talk too much about climate at all. Because the average person, when it comes to actual action, daily action, doesn\u2019t really want to do it.\n\nEfficiency is coming regardless of politics\n\nWOLF: I\u2019ve wondered about that with regard to electric vehicles. It seems like some people are turned off by them because it\u2019s making a political statement when you buy an EV instead of simply trying to get the best deal.\n\nWEIR: I think what you\u2019re seeing now is there\u2019s been such sudden market saturation that now there\u2019s a backlash, there\u2019s a glut or an oversupply.\n\nThese things happen in fits and starts. Offshore wind was super exciting. And then it hit inflation headwinds and supply chain problems. EVs were a novelty and a statement. And now there\u2019s a tyranny of choice. There\u2019s so many different models and sorting out all the incentives is still not easy.\n\nAt the same time, we\u2019ve crossed the point that I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going back to the internal combustion engine, as a species, the same way there was a certain point we weren\u2019t going back to horses. It just makes more sense.\n\nElectrifying everything is the ultimate result, I think, of all this. It\u2019s just a matter of how fast it takes.\n\nLook at these S-shaped curves of adaptation in history from the color television to the refrigerator that went from, you know, 10% of homes to 95% in a relatively short amount of time. We\u2019ve seen that same thing with solar and battery storage, the same kind of thing with heat pumps. And there\u2019s a big wave of efficiency and cleaner, more sustainable choices coming, regardless of the politics.\n\nThe coolest years of the rest of your life are behind you\n\nWOLF: I read in CNN\u2019s report that it was the warmest winter on record and that the planet was more than 2 degrees over the pre-industrial levels for a number of days in February. It seems clear that we\u2019re going to burst through the 2-degree tipping point that had been previously suggested as the tipping point for climate change. What is the next marker?\n\nWEIR: The hardest thing for most folks to grasp \u2013 I still have a hard time grasping it even though I live in the space every day \u2013 is that the record-shattering year that we just had isn\u2019t just the hottest year in 120,000 years or so. It\u2019s among the coolest years of the rest of our lives.\n\nAnd there has been no meaningful reduction in emissions. The human hand on the global thermostat still has it cranked all the way up. And until that changes, until the atmosphere stabilizes at a certain rate, it\u2019s just going to keep getting warmer.\n\nThe really scary stuff is what we don\u2019t see and what\u2019s much harder to measure and to communicate, which is that the ocean temperatures have broken a record every day for the last year.\n\nEvery new day on the calendar is the hottest such day that we\u2019ve ever recorded. What that means for marine ecosystems and coral reefs, which are the cradles of life in the oceans, and what it means for the power of storms as we head into hurricane season has scientists really, really worried.\n\nDaily life changes\n\nWOLF: What are the little things that people should be doing? I don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s realistically asking people to stop travel completely. You travel to cover these stories. How do you layer the climate into your daily life?\n\nWEIR: When you take on this beat, you see everything in life differently. I used to just see an ice cream truck and smile. Now I see the fumes coming off the generator. I think about the sugarcane fields that burn to make delicious treats. Everything has a cost if you really think about it.\n\nI absolutely think about my flight footprint and for years would offset my air miles with clean energy projects that are vetted, charities I believe in.\n\nBut we can\u2019t offset our way out of this problem. We have to come up with a way to fly sustainably, and we have to figure out a way to build our homes and source our food and make our clothing in much more efficient and sensible ways.\n\nOn the personal responsibility part of it, I do my best. I haven\u2019t owned a car in a few years. I\u2019m proud to say I have almost 4,000 miles on Citi Bikes (New York\u2019s bike-share service), but I just like riding a bike. I\u2019m not doing that to be some sort of Captain Planet statement maker; I just liked that way of getting around New York City. If I lived in Dallas or Chicago, it probably wouldn\u2019t work.\n\nCyclist take advantage of the annual Open Streets: Car-Free Earth Day in New York on April 22, 2023. Kena Betancur/AFP/Getty Images/File\n\nPersonal choices are important because they\u2019re an extension of our awareness of the problem of what\u2019s in our air, what\u2019s in our water, what our energy mix means for life as we know it and what it will mean for generations to come.\n\nWhat everybody chooses to do with that is important, but what is hugely important is talking about it. Letting it inform your choices as a consumer and a voter for sure.

In 2022, if you asked the average American to guess how many of their fellow countrymen and women both understand the climate crisis and are supportive of meaningful action, the average response was 33% to 40%, regardless of party. In reality, it is like 66% to 80%.\n\nThe authors of the paper call it \u201cpluralistic ignorance.\u201d If you care about an Earth in balance, you think you\u2019re outnumbered two to one, when the opposite is true.\n\nPeople are surrounded by allies they didn\u2019t know they had. People also underestimate how quickly nature can heal itself if given a chance and how quickly systems can adjust when people work together.\n\nThe pandemic taught us a lot of lessons, but it also produced a number of vaccines in record time when everyone was focused on one mission. So there\u2019s a lot of room for despair. But there\u2019s so many reasons for hope, and it\u2019s just really about the stories we tell around this topic.",

            "text": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) today joined Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) to introduce the Protecting Access to Credit for Small Businesses Act, a bill that would prevent the Biden administration from using the Small Business Administration (SBA) as a direct lender for the 7(a) Loan Program.\n\n\u201cFraud and inefficiency characterize the Small Business Administration\u2019s history in direct lending. The government shouldn\u2019t crowd out private lenders that are already doing a good job getting funds to the small businesses that need them. I\u2019m proud to partner with Sen. Scott to stop the SBA from replacing private lenders and those in our communities with Washington bureaucrats,\u201d said Kennedy.\n\n\u201cWhen acting as a direct lender, the SBA has a consistent history of failure and inefficiency when compared to the private sector. The administration\u2019s proposal is just a vehicle for a big government overreach into nearly all aspects of American life and private institutions. There\u2019s simply no reason to use the federal government to funnel tax dollars that will later be loaned back to small businesses,\u201d said Scott.\n\nThe Protecting Access to Credit for Small Businesses Act would block the SBA from issuing direct 7(a) loans and competing with small lenders.\n\nBackground:\n\nThe 7(a) Loan Program provides small businesses with loans of up to $5 million to help job creators grow and maintain their businesses. Today, small business owners work with private lenders in their communities to receive loans through the program.\n\nIn his 2025 budget request, President Biden proposed a small-dollar lending program that would allow the SBA to issue 7(a) program loans directly, forcing small lenders to compete with the federal government.\n\nDemocrats attempted to implement a similar direct lending option for the SBA in 2021. Kennedy, Scott and a dozen other Republicans wrote a letter warning that the federal government has a history of developing botched lending programs. The SBA\u2019s Inspector General, for example, estimated that the government-run Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) program issued $79 billion in fraudulent loans during the pandemic. Businesses also suffered lengthy delays while waiting for EIDL funding.\n\nPrivate lenders have a far better record of efficiently and safely distributing loans to small businesses. Under the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), private banks distributed $800 billion in loans to nearly 12 million small businesses. Fraud experts identified fewer than 1% of accounts as potentially fraudulent.\n\nSens. Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Ted Budd (R-N.C.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.) and Mike Braun (R-Ind.) also cosponsored the legislation.\n\nFull text of the Protecting Access to Credit for Small Businesses Act is available here.",

According to the complaint, the DOE\u2019s move earlier this year pausing major liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminal projects violated long-standing federal energy laws.\n\n\u201cBiden\u2019s unilateral decree disregards statutory mandates, flouts the legal process, upends the oil and gas industry, disrupts the Texas economy, and subverts our constitutional structure,\u201d said Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton.\n\n\u201cThe ban will drive billions of dollars in investment away from Texas, hinder our ability to maximize revenue for public schools, force Texas producers to flare excess natural gas instead of taking it to market, and annihilate critical jobs,\u201d he continued. \u201cI will not stand by while Biden attacks Texas.\u201d\n\nGOP LEADERS CONFRONT BIDEN\u2019S NEW CLIMATE CZAR ON KEY SECURITY RISKS LURKING IN GREEN AGENDA\n\nAccording to Paxton, the LNG export moratorium is unconstitutional, ignores the 1938 Natural Gas Act\u2019s \u201cpresumption in favor of exports\u201d and discards decades of DOE energy policy.\n\nIn arguing the alleged unconstitutionality of the policy, the states\u2019 complaint notes Article I of the Constitution vests Congress with \u201c[a]ll legislative Powers,\u201d including the power \u201c[t]o regulate Commerce with foreign Nations.\u201d Therefore, since blocking LNG exports can be considered a regulation of commerce, the DOE violated the Constitution, according to the lawsuit.\n\nTIKTOK ACTIVIST SAYS HE ADVISED WHITE HOUSE ON BIDEN\u2019S NEW NATURAL GAS MORATORIUM\n\n\u201cThe LNG Export Ban implicates an issue of profound national importance. LNG exports account for billions of dollars to the economy and thousands of jobs,\u201d the complaint states. \u201cThey also raise serious questions of national security. And this is an issue that has been the subject of proposed legislation and public attention in and outside of Congress.\u201d\n\nThe complaint accuses DOE of violating the Administrative Procedure Act which governs the procedures of administrative law. The states highlight that DOE failed to host any public comment period before finalizing its LNG policy without \u201cgood cause to forego the notice and comment requirement.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, the states argue the DOE failed to properly consider the Natural Gas Act and its provision that states the agency issue an export license before hearing from the public.\n\nDOZENS OF FORMER TOP FEDERAL OFFICIALS CALL ON CONGRESS TO STRIKE DOWN BIDEN\u2019S NATURAL GAS CRACKDOWN\n\n\u201cThe Biden administration\u2019s illegal attacks on American energy jeopardizes the livelihoods of thousands of hard-working Louisiana men and women, millions of dollars in tax revenue, and billions of dollars in infrastructure,\u201d said Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill.\n\n\u201cLNG continues to have an enormous positive economic impact for our state \u2014 especially on our hard-hit coastal communities, which continue to recover from a recent series of devastating hurricanes. Jobs like these grow the economy, reduce crime, and help address the out-migration problem,\u201d she continued. \u201cThe people of Louisiana are proud to power this nation. I\u2019m ready to fight for them.\u201d\n\nIn a surprise move in January, Biden ordered the DOE to pause pending permits for LNG export facilities while federal officials conduct a rigorous environmental review assessing the projects\u2019 carbon emissions, which could take more than a year to complete. The action was lauded by climate activists who have loudly called for such a move, which they said would help combat global warming.\n\nHowever, the move was blasted by industry groups, former federal officials and bipartisan lawmakers, who noted energy exports are vital for aiding allies in Europe and Asia. In the aftermath of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine two years ago, U.S. LNG largely filled the void left by Russian natural gas as U.S. allies sought to wean off Russian exports and punish the nation\u2019s economy, a plan Biden endorsed at the time.",

The move brings the total amount of student loan forgiveness approved by Biden administration to $143.6 billion for nearly 4 million borrowers.\n\n\"Of the estimated 43 million student loan borrowers in America, approximately 20% have either been approved for debt cancellation or have no current repayment obligation.\"\n\n\"For too long, our nation's teachers, nurses, social workers, firefighters, and other public servants faced logistical troubles and trap doors when they tried to access the debt relief they were entitled to under the law,\" U.S. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said in a statement.\n\n\"With this announcement, the Biden-Harris administration is showing how we're taking further steps not only to fix those trap doors, but also to expand opportunity to many more Americans,\" Cardona added. \"Today, more than 100 times more borrowers are eligible for PSLF than there were at the beginning of the administration.\"\n\nBefore 2021, only around 7,000 borrowers benefited from PSFL relief. During Biden's tenure, more than 871,000 people have had their student loan debt canceled after the administration updated and fixed key parts of the program, including by introducing a new help tool to simplify navigation of the debt relief process.\n\n\"The president gets it. Today, thousands more borrowers are finally able to imagine life after student debt,\" Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair (CPC) Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) said in a statement.\n\nJayapal noted that after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the president's student debt cancellation program last June, Biden and Cardona \"got to work\" and have been \"relentless in the pursuit of other avenues to help the millions of Americans burdened by student debt.\"\n\n\"With the administration's fixes to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, teachers, nurses, firefighters, and others in public service will see their relief sooner and can finally start putting their hard-earned income towards buying homes, investing in their communities, and taking care of their families,\" she added.\n\nStudent loan attorney Adam Minsky noted this week that \"of the estimated 43 million student loan borrowers in America, approximately 20% have either been approved for debt cancellation or have no current repayment obligation.\"\n\nAccording to the Education Data Initiative, U.S. student loan debt in the United States currently totals more than $1.7 trillion.\n\nSome advocates reacted to the Biden administration's announcement by calling for more debt relief and even tuition-free higher education.\n\n\"Americans have a right to an education, and it should be debt-free,\" the Student Debt Crisis Center said on social media. \"The time to #CancelStudentDebt is now, not later.\"\n\nFormer Democratic Ohio state Sen. Nina Turnerasserted: \"The more student debt canceled, the better. \"We must keep pushing for more; it's a nearly $2 trillion crisis.\"\n\n\n\n\"We must stop saddling our students with this debt to begin with,\" Turner added. \"We need tuition-free college.\"",

That\u2019s up from only about 7,000 such borrowers \u201cever receiving forgiveness prior to my Administration,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cAnd through all of our various student debt relief actions, nearly four million Americans have had their student debt cancelled under my Administration,\u201d he said.\n\nOfficials said the total amount of student loan cancellation issued by Biden so far is more than $143 billion.\n\nThe Public Service Loan Forgiveness program allows for debt forgiveness for people in jobs like firefighting, nursing and teaching after 10 years of continuous payment.\n\nThe Biden administration has made fixes to this program that had failed to deliver student loan relief to many due to poor implementations and errors in the program, officials have said.\n\nThe Biden administration will also send email notifications to 380,000 borrowers who are within two years of getting their loans forgiven through PSLF, to encourage them to stick with their payments.\n\nAccording to officials, 140,000 borrowers are on track to get this same forgiveness in less than a year.\n\nThere are 240,000 borrowers on track to have loan forgiveness in the next two years who will receive a similar email noting their timeline.\n\nBiden had earlier attempted a sweeping form of federal student loan cancellation \u2014 totaling an estimated $400 billion for 43 million people. But the U.S. Supreme Court rejected that as outside the scope of his authority.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024, ABC Audio. All rights reserved.",

            "text": "PALM BEACH, Florida \u2014 Former President Donald Trump told Breitbart News exclusively last week that he sees a new category of crime emerging in the United States because of President Joe Biden and his fellow Democrats\u2019 policies: \u201cMigrant crime.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a new form of crime in the United States\u2014it\u2019s called \u2018migrant crime,\u2019\u201d Trump told Breitbart News in a 90-minute exclusive interview at Mar-a-Lago last Wednesday. \u201cNow, it would be called and normally I would call it \u2018Biden migrant crime,\u2019 but that\u2019s too long and too crazy. But everyone knows we have a new category in crime. So we have crime, and we have migrant crime. It\u2019s vicious and it\u2019s horrible and these people are very tough. Everyone talks about the migrants coming to America; many of these people are real bad people. Many of them are sick. Many of them are mentally ill.\u201d\n\nTrump has made focusing on the plight of \u201cAngel Families,\u201d like the family of murdered 22-year-old Georgia nursing student Laken Riley, a key facet of his campaign to return to the White House. Sadly, Riley is hardly the only instance of Americans being killed by migrants in the country unlawfully and people who would not be otherwise hurt if the government enforced American immigration laws.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign, as Breitbart News reported exclusively before his and Biden\u2019s rivaling border trips a few weeks ago, released a brutal video highlighting many of the crimes, including rapes and murders, that migrants Biden let into the country have committed. Trump also, at his recent Georgia rally immediately after becoming the last remaining GOP presidential candidate and right before he locked up a majority of the delegates to the Republican National Convention this year, met with Riley\u2019s parents. He also intends to do more events and meetings throughout the year with Angel Families.\n\nTrump told Breitbart News that a big part of what\u2019s going wrong in Biden\u2019s America is that many of the migrants that Biden is letting into the country are bad criminals from Central American countries. He noted that crime is actually down in Venezuela, which he says is because Venezuela sent its criminals here to the United States.\n\n\u201cThe amazing thing about the border to me is I used to think, \u2018Who wants an open border where the world is coming into your country?\u2019\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt makes sense\u2014I don\u2019t know if you saw that it\u2019s 61 percent down in crime in Venezuela. So Venezuela, all their gangs are not even just coming up. They\u2019re being bussed right to our border and they\u2019re being forced in at gunpoint. We\u2019ve got these Venezuelan gangs, who are very tough gangs\u2014they make our gangs look like very nice people\u2014they\u2019re now migrants. I\u2019ve watched cops get roughed up over the years and watched them get shot in cars, but what I\u2019ve never watched is cops having fistfights in the middle of the street. They\u2019re duking it out. They\u2019re literally fighting these kids. I\u2019ve never seen that before. In their country, they\u2019d be dead immediately if that ever happened.\u201d\n\nHe also said that the crush of migrants into the country is severely hurting big cities like his previous home, New York City.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s amazing to me is I\u2019ve always heard how New York and all these other places don\u2019t have any money, but all of a sudden they\u2019re getting billions and billions of dollars to take care of this problem,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey have, I guess, 500,000 migrants in New York right? By the way, these are some tough people.\u201d",

Please enter a valid email address.\n\nThe Senate voted Thursday afternoon in favor of passing a bill reversing the Biden administration's recent actions allowing beef imports from Paraguay, which has a history of cattle-borne illness.\n\nIn a 70-25 vote, the Senate approved the Congressional Review Act resolution, rendering it veto-proof. Sens. Jon Tester, D-Mont., and Mike Rounds, R-S.D., introduced the bipartisan resolution in February, which has been widely endorsed by cattle and farm industry groups, arguing that the Department of Agriculture's (USDA) actions could have negative consequences on the U.S. food supply.\n\n\"President Biden butchered this decision,\" Tester said in a statement after the bill passed. \"By cutting corners to resume beef imports from a country with a recent history of foot-and-mouth disease, the Biden Administration is jeopardizing our food supply and giving Montana consumers and producers a raw deal.\"\n\n\"We cannot allow beef imports from Paraguay until we have data that shows they are meeting the same high animal health standards as American ranchers, and I\u2019m proud to have secured bipartisan support in the Senate to force the Biden administration to reverse course.\"\n\nGOP REP INTRODUCES RESOLUTION CONDEMNING UN FOR CALLING ON AMERICANS TO STOP EATING MEAT\n\nIn November, the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service finalized regulations allowing Paraguayan beef imports and issued a series of conditions that importers must meet to ensure that livestock diseases are not present in shipped products. The agency then began implementation of the rules one month later, despite criticism from lawmakers and U.S. industry groups.\n\nParaguay's livestock industry, though, has a history of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), which spreads quickly among livestock and could severely threaten the U.S. economy . As a result, beef imports from the South American nation have been barred in the U.S. for years.\n\nLOCAL RESIDENTS EXPLODE AT BIDEN OFFICIALS OVER PLAN TO RELEASE GRIZZLY BEARS NEAR THEIR COMMUNITIES\n\n\"South Dakota is known for having high quality beef produced by hard-working farmers and ranchers across the state,\" said Rounds. \"We have very high standards regarding the quality of our beef. Unfortunately, Paraguay does not have the same history of enforcing health and safety standards that we do. Our inspectors haven\u2019t been to Paraguay in ten years.\"\n\nUSDA's actions came after a push from Paraguayan officials who argued that the industry was vital for the nation and that the country's government had taken steps to ensure the health of its cattle.\n\nAccording to a readout of a September meeting between the Paraguayan government and the White House Office of the United States Trade Representative , the two sides discussed the process of authorization. Paraguayan officials expressed their desire to resume raw beef product trade \"as soon as possible.\"\n\nParaguayan cattle industry associations and government agencies, including the Embassy of Paraguay to the U.S., submitted comments in May 2023 in response to the proposed version of the regulations finalized last year. The comments similarly urged the USDA to immediately allow beef imports.\n\nBIDEN ADMIN BACKS OFF PROTECTIONS FOR APEX PREDATOR, ANGERING ENVIRONMENTALISTS\n\n\"The Government of Paraguay and its diplomatic representation here in Washington are more than open to providing additional assurances regarding our compliance with the United States' safety standards,\" a spokesperson for the Embassy of Paraguay told Fox News Digital in a statement.\n\n\"We believe that the meat industries of our two countries have a lot of potential for opportunities and collaboration, especially in the exchange of knowledge in cattle breeding, herd management, sustainable practices, and trade and investment.\"\n\nThe spokesperson said that USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service agents conducted two on-site audits in Paraguay in December 2021 and June 2022. And they said that the nation has demonstrated its capability to comply with U.S. standards and regulations.\n\nThe White House issued a statement disapproving the resolution, saying it would \"mark a significant setback in the United States-Paraguay bilateral relationship and U.S. credibility as a reliable economic partner across Latin America.\"\n\nCLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHowever, the National Cattlemen\u2019s Beef Association (NCBA), U.S. Cattlemen\u2019s Association, Livestock Marketing Association, R-CALF USA, National Farmers Union, Montana Farmers Union, Montana Stockgrowers Association and Montana Farm Bureau Federation all praised the Senate's passage of the resolution.\n\n\"Given Paraguay\u2019s long history of foot-and-mouth disease outbreaks, it is simply too risky to allow Paraguayan imports without recent site visits to confirm Paraguay\u2019s safety claims,\" said NCBA Executive Director of Government Affairs Kent Baucus. \"U.S. cattle producers are thankful for the leadership of Senators Jon Tester and Mike Rounds for applying the Congressional Review Act to hold USDA accountable and protect our nation\u2019s cattle herd.\"",

In this conversation, Trump reportedly warned Pence that certifying Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 election could end Pence's political career, characterizing it as a \"career killer.\" The testimony of a White House valet, who was present during the call, illuminated Trump's efforts to pressure Pence amidst the turmoil of the Capitol attack and Trump's apparent indifference to the violence that occurred that day, including the shooting of Ashli Babbitt.\n\nThis transcript, coupled with Trump's public criticism of Pence for lacking the courage to overturn the election results, highlighted the strain in their relationship and the internal conflicts within the administration as the Capitol siege unfolded. Pence, in his memoir \"So Help Me God,\" acknowledged the pressure from Trump but focused on his constitutional duties during the chaos.\n\nIn another matter adding to the internal discord among Republicans, Trump's recent suggestion of a 15-week national abortion ban has sparked unease within the party. With the GOP facing challenges in forming a unified stance on reproductive rights, some Republican senators, including Tommy Tuberville and Chuck Grassley, have shown hesitancy in addressing Trump's abortion comments, reflecting the sensitivity of the issue within the party.\n\nThese events underline the ongoing controversies surrounding Trump and the internal dynamics of the Republican Party in the aftermath of the January 6 riot and amid evolving debates on key issues such as abortion rights.",

But, the officials said, Netanyahu was unmoved. The officials said the Biden administration is trying to lay the groundwork with other Israeli and civil society leaders in anticipation of an eventual post-Netanyahu government. In an attempt to work around Netanyahu, Blinken also met individually with members of his war Cabinet and other Israeli leaders, including opposition leader and former Prime Minister Yair Lapid, officials said.\n\nBut Blinken faces two obstacles: one, that Israelis believe that they are, in fact, capable of winning the war, and that they are doing so; two, that Palestinians themselves do not want a state more than they want to destroy Israel, meaning a state is doomed to fail.\n\nOn the first point, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, delivered a comprehensive summary Wednesday night of the war\u2019s progress. While fighting in the southern portion of Gaza remains challenging, he said, the IDF had largely destroyed Hamas in the northern and central regions of the territory. The south is where Hamas\u2019s leaders are believed to be hiding underground \u2014 surrounded by over 100 Israeli hostages, whom they are using as bargaining chips and human shields.\n\nIsraelis are nearly unanimous in their determination to destroy Hamas \u2014 a dramatic shift in attitudes since the October 7 terror attack, when Israelis were largely prepared to ignore Hamas as long as it did not attack them. The mass murder of 1,200 people, along with the abduction of 253 more, mostly civilians, changed attitudes in Israel across the political spectrum.\n\nMany left-wing Israelis who once considered themselves \u201cmore Palestinian than the Palestinians\u201d now see all Palestinians as a potential threat.\n\nAccording to Gallup, nearly two-thirds of Israelis now oppose a Palestinian state, given what Hamas did to them, and to Gaza \u2014 and given the pro-terror sympathies of the corrupt Palestinian Authority, which governs most Palestinians in the West Bank.\n\nThat is a radical reversal from the position of most Israelis just a decade ago, when \u201ctwice as many Israeli adults supported an independent Palestinian state (61%) as opposed one (30%).\u201d Hamas\u2019s rocket and terror attacks are responsible for the change.\n\nBlinken and President Joe Biden are committed to the old, failed model of Middle East peacemaking, in which the Palestinian issue must precede all others. President Donald Trump rejected that idea \u2014 and the result was the historic Abraham Accords.\n\nNow, Biden and Blinken are trying to make new peace agreements \u2014 such as a Saudi-Israeli peace deal \u2014 contingent on the creation of a Palestinian state. And Blinken is casting Israelis as if they are not ready for peace, in contrast to the Arab world.\n\nThat is a total inversion of the truth, according to opinion polls, which suggest that the vast majority of Palestinians support Hamas\u2019s terror attack of October 7. Arab public opinion is similar, though the Abraham Accords have remained intact so far.\n\nNBC News also reports that Blinken is pushing a deal in which Saudi Arabia would agree to normalized relations with Israel in return for a Palestinian state. Ironically, Saudi Arabia was on the verge of a deal without a Palestinian state before October 7.\n\nIt was the Biden administration, according to one report, that actually stalled that deal by insisting on additional concessions to the Palestinians \u2014 concessions that the Saudis did not demand and for which the Palestinians did not agree to any compromises.\n\nJoel B.

Those with multiple federal student loans who request a consolidation by April 30 \u2014 which will leave them with one, larger loan \u2014 could benefit from the U.S. Department of Education's overhaul of income-driven repayment plans. Those changes have already led to debt cancelation for more than 930,000 people and $45 billion in relief. \"The opportunity to consolidate loans will help many more borrowers to qualify for student loan forgiveness,\" said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. Here's what to know about the deadline.\n\nConsolidation can get you closer to loan forgiveness\n\nIncome-driven repayment plans, which date to 1994, set borrowers' monthly payments based on a share of their discretionary income. Those payments are typically lower than under standard repayment, and can be zero under some plans. Borrowers typically get any remaining debt forgiven after 10, 20 or 25 years, depending on the plan. One complicating factor for borrowers in these programs is that they often have multiple loans, taken out at different times, Kantrowitz said. \"They get at least one new loan each year in school, on average,\" he said. That can mean a borrower has multiple timelines to forgiveness, one for each of those loans. More from Personal Finance:\n\nFAFSA fiasco may cause drop in college enrollment, experts say\n\nHarvard is back on top as the ultimate 'dream' school\n\nMore of the nation's top colleges roll out no-loan policies Now, the Biden administration is temporarily offering borrowers the chance to combine their loans and to get credit going back as far as their first loan payment on the oldest of their original loans in that bundle. For example, say a borrower graduated from college in 2004, took out more loans for a graduate degree in 2018 and is now in repayment under an income-driven plan with a 20-year timeline to forgiveness. Consolidating could lead them to immediately qualify for forgiveness on all of those loans, experts say. In normal times, consolidating your student loans can be a terrible move for those hoping to get rid of their debt as your forgiveness timeline is restarted. But the Biden administration has changed that program detail through April 30.\n\nWhat to know about consolidating your student loans\n\nAll federal student loans are eligible for consolidation, including Federal Family Education Loans, Parent Plus loans and Perkins Loans, Kantrowitz said. You can apply for a Direct Consolidation Loan at StudentAid.gov or with your loan servicer. \"So long as the application is submitted by April 30, they should be fine, even if the servicers takes longer to process it,\" Kantrowitz said.\n\nSome borrowers who took out small amounts may even be eligible for cancelation after as few as 10 years' worth of payments, if they enroll in the new income-driven repayment option, known as the SAVE plan. Consolidating your loans shouldn't increase your monthly payment, since your bill under an income-driven repayment plan is based on your earnings and not your total debt, Kantrowitz said. Your new interest rate will be a weighted average of the rates across your loans.",

            "text": "Former US President Donald Trump\u2019s social media firm \u2014 which is the parent company of his social networking site Truth Social \u2014 would soon go public, adding billions of dollars to his net worth and potentially helping him pay his mounting legal bills.\n\nThe development came after investors of a shell company, Digital World Acquisition Corp, approved a merger currently worth about $5.7 billion with Trump\u2019s firm, Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), on Friday (March 22).\n\nAs Trump owns 60% of TMTG, he stands to get $3 billion from the deal, which will double his wealth from the current $2.6 billion estimate by Forbes magazine in October 2023. However, it remains uncertain how quickly Trump will get access to the cash.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere is a look at why the merger is crucial for Trump and what stops him from getting the money soon.\n\nWhat is Truth Social?\n\nTruth Social was launched in early 2022, soon after Trump was banned on Facebook and X (formerly known as Twitter) following his role in the January 6 US Capitol attack. The social media platform aimed to connect the former President with his support base.\n\nSpeaking to ABC News, Roxana Muenster, a doctoral student at Cornell University who studies the far-right and digital communication, said: \u201cIt is marketed in opposition to mainstream media apps, which Trump and his supporters allege discriminate against their views and limit free expression. Its content and audience are overwhelmingly conservative and made up of the MAGA base. There is also a lot of hate speech and extremism on the platform due to their lax approach to content moderation.\u201d\n\nMuch like other right-leaning social media sites such as Gettr and Parler, Truth Social doesn\u2019t have a large user base. According to research firm Similarweb, the platform had around 5 million active users, including mobile users and website visitors, as of February 2023, ABC News reported.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn comparison, TikTok had 2 billion and Facebook had more than 3 billion users. But when it comes to its rival in the alternative social-media space, Truth Social has a much wider user base. For instance, Gettr had less than 2 million visitors in February, the ABC News report said.\n\nIn terms of user interface, Truth Social seems like a clone of X. Users have a profile and they can follow each other. They post \u201ctruths\u201d or \u201cretruths\u201d and can send direct messages. Advertisements are called \u201csponsored truths\u201d.\n\nWhy is the merger crucial for Trump?\n\nAs Trump is facing a host of criminal and civil cases, his legal spending has dramatically shot up. A fundraising group \u2014 Save America PAC \u2014 run by him, spent more than $5.5 million just in February on legal fees, according to a report by Reuters.\n\nAlso in Explained | Is the President immune from prosecution? US Supreme Court to decide on Trump case\n\n\u201cThe spending marked an acceleration from the close to $3 million Save America reported spending on legal bills in January. The group, which raises money together with Trump\u2019s election campaign but is legally separate, has now spent more than $55 million on legal bills since the start of 2023,\u201d the report said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoreover, Trump has to pay a $454 million penalty by Monday in a civil fraud case, which accuses him of inflating the value of his real estate holdings in deals with banks.\n\nTherefore, the merger of Digital World and TMTG has come at a critical time for Trump, who is supposed to receive $3 billion from the deal. The merger will also infuse TMTG, which has been financially struggling, with a vital $300 million.\n\n\u201cThe social media company lost $10.6 million from its operations in the first nine months of 2023 on revenue of $3.4 million,\u201d Reuters report said.\n\nWhy might Trump not receive cash quickly?\n\nAlthough shares of TMTG could begin trading on the stock market as early as Monday, it is possible that Trump won\u2019t be able to cash in on his stake for a while. Under the current agreement, Trump is barred from selling his shares in the company for at least six months or using them as collateral for loans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis might soon change, though. Given Trump\u2019s extensive control over TMTG, a majority of the company\u2019s new board members are expected to be his allies. They could help him reach a deal, which would allow him to sell the shares or his stake earlier than six months.",

This was in response to a report from the New York Instances exhibiting that the CIA was throughout Ukraine.\n\nOn Thursday evening, Benz launched a brand new video clip arguing that that Hunter Biden was advancing a CIA challenge in Ukraine to swing the pure gasoline market in the direction of NATO and that\u2019s why he\u2019s untouchable.\n\nRight here is the transcript from the video on X.\n\nMike Benz: I simply have to interrupt this down in a video to make it completely plain and clear to individuals what\u2019s taking place with Hunter Biden and the CIA. Why was I saying a 12 months and a half in the past that the explanation Hunter Biden is untouchable by the Justice Division is as a result of he was a part of a CIA operation. A number of ones, really.\n\nYou need to perceive what\u2019s occurring right here. Let me simply provide you with a dozen information factors on Hunter Biden CIA. The very first thing is, Hunter was on the Chairman\u2019s Advisory Board of the Nationwide Democratic Institute, the NDI. The NDI is the DNC wing of the Nationwide Endowment for Democracy, which is the highest CIA cutout utilized in our tens of 1000\u2019s of NGO swarms. NED ranks primary. It was created to be the NGO affiliate of the CIA. It was created to do overtly what the CIA was doing covertly and getting in bother for doing within the twentieth century, created underneath the Reagan administration in 1983. There\u2019s one thing known as the NDI for Democrats and the for Republicans, the CIA wing of the Republican Social gathering. They each break up spoils, mainly on US international coverage jobs that the CIA orchestrates.\n\nYou don\u2019t get to be a part of the chairman\u2019s advisory committee of the NDI except you\u2019re CIA-linked or CIA-vetted. It\u2019s a CIA. \u2013 NGOs, government-organized, non-governmental organizations. It is a CIA-organize a CIA-organized, non-CIA group. It\u2019s the CIA. He\u2019s on the chairman\u2019s advisory board of that. By the best way, when he was at Burisma, who was the opposite individual on the Barisma board from the US there was Cofer Black, who had spent 30 years within the CIA. Cofer Black was Mitt Romney\u2019s Sherpa to the intelligence neighborhood throughout his presidential run in 2012. what? Mitt Romney is on the board of the IRI, who I simply talked about, the Worldwide Republican Institute, the CIA lower out counterpart to the NDI. Barisma was a CIA operation. Let me say this once more. Burisma was a CIA operation. So was Naftagas. That\u2019s the general public after which, respectively, the non-public and public pure gasoline corporations there. There have been a few different non-public ones along with Burisma. However the CIA was making an attempt to interrupt down Gazprom and swing the gasoline market from Russia to NATO. They\u2019ve been making an attempt to do that for 16 friggin\u2019 years.\n\nIt\u2019s been an in-process CIA, State Division, Pentagon challenge for 16 frigging years. They had been making an attempt to capability construct Burisma and shift its board to make it US-controlled. They\u2019re doing the identical factor concurrently with Naftogaz, the feeder that Burisma feeds into. You may even learn concerning the energy wrestle between George Soros and Vladimir Putin for management over Naftogaz, the state-owned titan that has been the privatization prize of the IMF. That\u2019s, that was a part of the explanation that we overthrew the Ukrainian authorities in 2014, is to denationalise these belongings as a result of we knew that we had been going to be chopping Russia off. So Western stakeholders needed to revenue from this trillion-dollar windfall if Russia may very well be kicked out the European power market.\n\nThat is widespread exercise for the Central Intelligence Company, which was created by company legal professionals in 1947 as its top quality. The company espionage facet of the CIA operation right here has geopolitical dimensions. Should you kill Russia\u2019s power exports, you kill their army, which suggests you kill their skill to run air protection programs to Syria. You kill their skill to run small arms to sub-Saharan Africa to oppose US management over lithium and cobalt and copper and aluminum and gold and oil and gasoline there, too.\n\nThis was a long-range CIA challenge the place Hunter Biden occurred to be ass deep in precisely the primary geopolitical goal of what the CIA was doing underneath the Obama administration, which is making an attempt to kill Russia\u2019s power exports. In the meantime, you had this endogenous Ukrainian gasoline firm that Hunter\u2019s on the board of. By the best way, who\u2019s Hunter\u2019s dad on the time? It\u2019s Joe Biden, the vice President answerable for the Ukraine portfolio. However Joe Biden spent 30 10 years on the Senate International Relations Committee, 10 years rotating between chairman and rating member. That\u2019s the coordinating wing of the Senate with the State Division and the CIA. It\u2019s particularly Central and Jap Europe. Joe Biden was massively concerned within the Yugoslavia operation within the late Nineteen Nineties, and breaking that up, which once more was a CIA job, okay? That\u2019s why it\u2019s a must to perceive the construction of the blob. Everytime you see the State Division, the CIA CIA is there and the Pentagon are there, and also you simply don\u2019t see it but. Everytime you see the CIA, the State Division and the Pentagon there, you simply don\u2019t see it but. Even British intelligence is throughout this LNG story.\n\nYou don\u2019t get British intelligence with out US intelligence. The very fact is, the CIA will lean on the Justice Division. I simply did six hours of subscriber streams concerning the relationship between CIA and DOJ, and that the CIA will lean on DOJ to kill investigations into felony exercise involving belongings of the CIA in order that they will proceed to do work that\u2019s within the US nationwide curiosity, even when it\u2019s a felony enterprise.\n\nAs a result of the CIA has a license to try this. They\u2019ve the license to crime underneath NSC 10-2. They\u2019re licensed to do felony exercise so long as it\u2019s plausibly deniable. Hunter Biden was part of a plausibly deniable CIA operation to swing the gasoline market in the direction of That\u2019s why it\u2019s untouchable.",

She answered that even in uberconservative northwest Georgia, her politics differ from some of her peers\u2019.\n\n\u201cBeing in high school, some people are like, \u2018Why are you doing that?'\u201d she said, referring to her Trump fandom. \u201cI mean, a lot of people \u2014 this is going to sound really sad, but a lot of people don\u2019t stand for [the] flag. But I do. I always will.\u201d\n\ntoggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nChip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nThe grievance of the underdog\n\nWhat\u2019s so frustrating is that the leftist wing focuses so much on minorities that it feels like me as a white man, that I am the minority.\u201d\n\nThe aggressive merch suggests that wearers expect, even relish, opposition. And Trump rallies have perhaps a more confrontational feel than ever, amid his four indictments, and his insistence that he won in 2020. All the voters I asked about 2020 also think Trump won that election. He didn\u2019t.\n\nMidmorning, a few hundred deep into the line, Angie Patrick had just helped a friend wriggle into a new t-shirt reading \u201cGod, Guns, and Trump\u201d. Patrick said me she has her own way of fighting for the former president.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a digital warrior. That means sharing things that perhaps maybe the mainstream media doesn\u2019t necessarily share with the public,\u201d she explained.\n\nShe mentioned multiple conspiracy theories she believes in and said she had been kicked off of Twitter 31 times (pre-Elon Musk\u2019s tenure, that is).\n\nTo Patrick, Trump is beleaguered and bullied\u2026but also massively powerful. It\u2019s a careful needle he has managed to thread with his followers.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s beaten the odds. And I like an underdog,\u201d she said. But she quickly added, \u201calthough I don\u2019t think Trump is an underdog. I think he\u2019s definitely the front dog.\u201d\n\nA lot of Trump\u2019s supporters themselves feel like underdogs.\n\nBy mid-afternoon, people were taking their seats in the city arena. One of them, college student Zachary Wright, said he feels economically strapped, but also feels marginalized culturally.\n\n\u201cIf the economy keeps on getting worse and worse and worse, then how much is it going to cost for my kids to get lunch? And not only that, what\u2019s so frustrating is that the leftist wing focuses so much on minorities that it feels like me as a white man, that I am the minority.\u201d\n\nWe versus \u2018they\u2019\n\nAll afternoon, people queued for concessions and restrooms, chatting with their fellow Trump disciples.\n\nBut the mood darkened as Trump\u2019s opening act took the stage \u2014 a run of right-wing politicians. Their message was that the Trump movement has an endless string of enemies outside the arena.\n\nRepresentative Marjorie Taylor Greene, for example, repeatedly referenced a nameless \u201cthey.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe said build the wall. And they were offended. We said back the blue and they were offended, right?\u201d she added, as the crowd started booing in agreement.\n\ntoggle caption Danielle Kurtzleben/NPR\n\nDanielle Kurtzleben/NPR\n\nAt a Trump rally, even the rioters who attacked the capitol on Jan. 6 are recast as victims of anti-Trump forces.\n\n\u201cLadies and gentlemen,\u201d an announcer\u2019s deep voice boomed over dramatic music. \u201cPlease rise for the horribly and unfairly treated January 6 hostages.\u201d\n\nLately, Trump takes the stage after a recording of the national anthem sung by those jailed for that attack. While Trump\u2019s indictment for his actions on Jan. 6 looms over his campaign, he also embraces that day. Indeed, he has said he plans to pardon many of the convicted rioters.\n\nTrump started speaking in Rome at around 6:00 p.m., about an hour late. He would remain on stage for nearly 2 hours \u2014 long even for a Trump rally speech.\n\nAs usual, the demonization of undocumented immigrants was a key focus and drew loud cheers.\n\n\u201cWhat Joe Biden has done on our border is a crime against humanity and the people of this nation for which he will never be forgiven. We\u2019re going to fix it. We\u2019re going to fix it fast. We\u2019re going to have the largest deportation in history,\u201d he said, to thunderous applause.\n\nEven when his particular wording doesn\u2019t make headlines, Trump\u2019s speeches are full of false \u2014 and sometimes strange \u2014 rhetoric about migrants.\n\n\u201cThey always say suburban housewives, they want something that\u2019s very important: security,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201cThey don\u2019t want illegal immigrants coming into our country. They don\u2019t want illegal immigrants knocking on their front door and saying, \u2018I\u2019m going to use your kitchen, and I\u2019m going to use your bedroom, and there\u2019s not a damn thing-\u2018 And that\u2019s the nice ones, okay?\u201d\n\nThe speech went beyond immigration though, meandering toward many more of trump\u2019s grievances \u2014 yes, against Joe Biden, but also Fulton County, Ga., prosecutor Fani Willis, N.Y. Attorney General Letitia James, Megyn Kelly and Martha Stewart\u2026to name a few.\n\nIn addition, he praised Hungarian autocrat Viktor Orban and North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un.\n\nAfter it all, the evening ended with a familiar benediction: \u201cWe will make America great again.\u201d\n\nJust outside, Tynisha Williams said she had a great time. She added \u2014 paradoxically \u2014 she thinks Trump\u2019s divisiveness will unify the U.S.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for the kid gloves to be taken off,\u201d she said. \u201cYou need to know the hard truth. And the hard truth is we need to come back together as a country. We need to get this country back together. And we got to unite. We gotta make this country great again, as simple as that.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how Trump would unite the nation, however. A week later, at another rally, he would say that some undocumented immigrants aren\u2019t people, whipping up another firestorm of controversy.",

British military sources are worried that Trump\u2019s remarks will strengthen Putin\u2019s resolve over Ukraine, and could result in him advancing on even more territory.\n\nEven before Trump emerged on the US political scene, the Baltic countries have been especially concerned about Russia\u2019s growing ambitions. They have, after all, been invaded and occupied by Russia before, in 1940, and then forced to become part of the Soviet Union. There\u2019s plenty of people who can still remember life in the Soviet Union.\n\nSince Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea in 2014, the Baltic states have been the loudest voices sounding the alarm about the existential threat posed by Russia, and all three countries increased their military spending to more than 2% of their GDP, and recently agreed to raise it to 3%.\n\nBuilding shared defences\n\nAmid growing security concerns, the defence ministers in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia also agreed in January to set up a common Baltic defence zone on their borders with Russia and Belarus. This would consist of building physical defensive structures such as bunkers.\n\nEstonia will begin construction of 600 bunkers in early 2025. The nations will also cooperate in developing missile artillery, and ensuring that their equipment, ammunition and manpower is updated.\n\n\n\nSopa/Alamy\n\n\n\nEstonia has also doubled the size of its territorial defence force to 20,000 people, while Latvia reintroduced conscription in 2023 after becoming the only Baltic state to stop mandatory military service in 2006.\n\nLatvia also plans to double the size of its armed forces to 61,000 by the year 2032. Meanwhile, Lithuania has made an agreement with Germany to allow a permanent brigade of 4,800 of its troops to be combat ready on the Russian border by 2027.\n\nPutin\u2019s pledge to Russian speakers\n\nBut given that Russia borders 14 countries, why are the Baltic states especially concerned about their security? In addition to being geographically close, a notable number of ethnic Russians live in the Baltic countries (5% in Lithuania; 25% in Estonia and 36% in Latvia. In the eastern Estonian city of Narva, 95.7% of the population are native Russian speakers and 87.7% are ethnic Russians.\n\nThis matters as Putin has argued that having substantial numbers of ethnic Russians living outside of Russia, due to the \u201ccatastrophic\u201d dissolution of the Soviet Union, represents a \u201chumanitarian disaster of epic proportions\u201d as it left Russians cut off from \u201ctheir motherland\u201d. Putin has vowed to actively protect all \u201cRussians\u201d living abroad.\n\nIn particular, Putin has said he was concerned about how ethnic Russians are being treated in the Baltics, remarking that the deportation of ethnic Russians (most notably in Latvia where there have been recent changes to its immigration laws), poses a threat to Russian national security.\n\nThe Kremlin has also protested the demolition of Soviet monuments in the Baltics, placing Estonia\u2019s prime minster, Kaja Kallas, on its wanted list for doing so.\n\nBut these claims about wanting to protect Russians abroad, are really just a pretext to justify escalation with the Baltics, which will test Nato\u2019s alliance and destabilise the organisation. So it\u2019s not just important that there are ethnic Russians living there \u2013 there are strategic reasons as well that make them an easy target.\n\nEven with the Baltic countries strengthening their troop numbers, Russia currently has 1.32 million active military personnel, and two million active reserve. Combined this is greater that Lithuania\u2019s entire population of 2.8 million people, and far greater than Estonia and Latvia which have populations of 1.3 million and 1.8 million people, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more:\n\nThe EU should stop \u2018westsplaining\u2019 and listen to its smaller eastern members \u2013 they saw the Ukraine war coming\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Lithuania, which borders Belarus and Russian-run mini-state Kaliningrad, there are concerns that it could be taken over first by Russian forces, which would then physically isolate Lithuania from the rest of the Baltics. The Kaliningrad region has become increasingly militarised in recent years, with Iskander ballistic missiles and S-400 systems installed. With Trump suggesting he would weaken the US\u2019s commitment to Nato if elected, there won\u2019t be much of a deterrent for Putin to grab low-hanging fruit.\n\nThe current Nato response force consists of approximately 40,000 troops, with plans to upgrade to 300,000 troops. But quick-reaction units could still be too slow to protect the Baltics from Russian forces as, ironically, moving large units, vehicles and ammunition across borders is bureaucratic and takes time. It would be important to have excellent intelligence and to move quickly, something that will be made more difficult with the US potentially opting out of its commitments.\n\nThough Russia has plunged much of its resources into winning the Ukraine war, Putin still aims to expand Russian sovereignty across the post-Soviet states and to effectively dismantle Nato, something that Trump takes no issue with. As Russia has been ramping up its war machine, the Baltic states firmly believe that Russian aggression will not stop at Ukraine, and that they could be next.",

            "text": "In a recent commentary, a prominent conservative voice raised a compelling argument that may prompt a shift in the traditional voting patterns of some Republicans, particularly in their stance towards former President Donald Trump.\n\nThe commentator in question, Mona Charen, who has a background as a staffer in the Reagan White House and is currently a columnist for The Bulwark, has publicly criticized another veteran of the Reagan era for expressing dissatisfaction with the electoral choices available this year, Raw Story reported.\n\nCharen\u2019s critique goes beyond mere disapproval; she boldly suggests that devout conservatives should seriously reconsider their allegiance to Trump, advocating instead for support towards a third-party candidate, or more radically, a switch to support Democrat President Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cThe world might look very different if traditional Republicans had been willing to stand firm for their values when they came under assault from an ignorant, cruel demagogue,\u201d Charen wrote. \u201cSo I was briefly optimistic when I saw that an honest-to-goodness Reaganite, John Lehman, who served as secretary of the Navy under Reagan, had weighed in [with a Wall Street Journal op-ed]. The headline was promising: \u2018Reagan Would Never Vote for Trump.\u2019 But after that bold beginning, the subhead was deflating: \u2018He also didn\u2019t care much for Biden. Like me, he\u2019d be looking for a strong third-party candidate to support,\u201d Charen continued.\n\nCharen\u2019s contention is not made lightly. She acknowledges the longstanding grievances that many conservatives, including those from the Reagan era, have held against Biden. These grievances stem from Biden\u2019s historical opposition to the Supreme Court nomination of Robert Bork\u2014a move that rankled many in the conservative camp during the 1980s\u2014as well as his advocacy for a nuclear freeze, a stance at odds with the prevailing conservative doctrine of the time.\n\nHowever, Charen finds it bewildering that despite these past conflicts, there seems to be a reluctance to support Biden, who, in her view, stands as the most viable contender against Trump\u2019s bid to disrupt the constitutional and democratic fabric of the nation.\n\nCharen\u2019s argument extends beyond mere political strategy; it touches on a moral imperative that she believes should guide the decision-making of Republicans in this crucial election. Drawing on the sentiments expressed by Dick Cheney, who has characterized Trump as an unprecedented threat to the American republic in its over two-century history, Charen implores her fellow conservatives to reassess their priorities.\n\nShe criticizes the tendency to treat voting as an exercise in maintaining ideological purity or preserving one\u2019s conservative credentials, arguing that such an approach is myopic and overlooks the broader implications of a potential Trump reelection.\n\nThe stakes, as Charen outlines, are not just political but existential for the values and institutions that define the American republic. She warns of the dire consequences that could ensue from Trump\u2019s return to power, including the undermining of cherished freedoms and the erosion of democratic traditions.\n\nCharen is particularly alarmed by Trump\u2019s promises, which include pardoning individuals involved in the January 6 insurrection, targeting his critics with imprisonment, and fostering an alliance with Russia. These actions, she argues, represent a clear and present danger to the nation\u2019s democratic framework.\n\nIn framing her argument, Charen seeks to galvanize a sense of urgency among Republicans, urging them to make a decisive choice in the face of an election that could significantly alter the course of American democracy. She posits that a reelected Biden would ensure the stability and security of the nation, contrasting starkly with the tumultuous and potentially authoritarian trajectory that a Trump victory could herald.\n\nFor Charen, the decision is not just about political affiliation or loyalty to conservative principles; it is about safeguarding the foundational values and institutions that underpin American democracy.\n\nIt\u2019s official. Joe Biden is the Democratic nominee for President. Democrats, Republicans, Independents. Anyone who cares about preventing a morally bankrupt sociopathic from destroying our Democracy, will vote for Joe and preserve our 249 years of self rule. \u2014 Rob Reiner (@robreiner) March 13, 2024\n\nHere is a montage of Republicans saying they will not vote for Donald Trump in November pic.twitter.com/lgaMLNkhZU \u2014 Biden-Harris HQ (@BidenHQ) March 16, 2024\n\n27% of Ohio voters are voting against Trump tonight.

            "text": "Biden says the agreement was a compromise, \u201cwhich means neither side got everything it wanted.\u201d\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Joe Biden on Saturday signed a $1.2 trillion package of spending bills after Congress had passed the long overdue legislation just hours earlier, ending the threat of a partial government shutdown.\n\n\u201cThis agreement represents a compromise, which means neither side got everything it wanted,\u201d Biden said in a statement. \u201cBut it rejects extreme cuts from House Republicans and expands access to child care, invests in cancer research, funds mental health and substance use care, advances American leadership abroad, and provides resources to secure the border. ... That\u2019s good news for the American people.\u201d\n\nIt took lawmakers six months into the current budget year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term spending bills to keep agencies funded.\n\nThe White House said Biden signed the legislation at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where he was spending the weekend. It had cleared the Senate by a 74-24 vote shortly after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight.\n\nBut the White House had sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing that the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the Democratic president would sign it Saturday.\n\nThe first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies. The second covered the departments of Defense, Homeland Security and State, as well as other aspects of general government.\n\nWhen combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country\u2019s rising debt.\n\nOn Ukraine aid, which Biden and his administration have argued was critical and necessary to help stop Russia\u2019s invasion, the package provided $300 million under the defense spending umbrella. That funding is separate from a large assistance package for Ukraine and Israel that is bogged down on Capitol Hill.\n\nBiden, in his statement, again pressed Congress to pass additional aid.\n\n\u201cThe House must pass the bipartisan national security supplemental to advance our national security interests. And Congress must pass the bipartisan border security agreement \u2014 the toughest and fairest reforms in decades \u2014 to ensure we have the policies and funding needed to secure the border. It\u2019s time to get this done.\u201d\n\nA bipartisan border package collapsed last month when Republicans senators scuttled months of negotiations with Democrats on legislation intended to cut back record numbers of illegal border crossings.\n\nTo win over support from Republicans, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., pointed to some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That\u2019s about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.\n\nDemocrats are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer\u2019s research.\n\nThe spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy of California worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.\n\nProspects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. But shortly before midnight, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced a breakthrough.\n\n\u201cIt is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it,\" Schumer said.\n\nThe House passed the legislation Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval.\n\nThe vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill \u201crepresents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.\u201d\n\nIn sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove McCarthy.",

He added, \u201cWe do not see a way to eliminate Hamas militarily without destroying these remaining battalions. We are determined to do it.\u201d\n\nThe White House warned on Monday \u2013 after Biden\u2019s 45-minute telephone call with Netanyahu \u2013 that a major ground operation in Rafah \u201cwould be a mistake.\u201d Summing up the call, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told reporters, \u201cIt would lead to more innocent civilian deaths, worsen the already dire humanitarian crisis, deepen the anarchy in Gaza and further isolate Israel internationally.\u201d\n\nBiden had previously insisted that Israel provide a credible plan for preventing civilian casualties in Rafah before launching its offensive, but with rising political fallout over Palestinian civilian casualties, he has taken a tougher stance against Netanyahu. The US president expressed support on Friday for US Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer after the lawmaker gave a speech arguing that Netanyahu had \u201clost his way\u201d and become an obstacle to peace in the region.\n\nThe war erupted when Hamas launched surprise raids against southern Israeli villages on October 7, killing more than 1,100 people and taking hundreds of hostages back to Gaza. Since then, more than 31,000 people have been killed in the besieged Palestinian enclave, according to local authorities, and around 1.5 million starving Gazans have been crammed into Rafah after Israeli bombardments leveled their neighborhoods.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announced last week that displaced civilians will be moved to \u201chumanitarian islands\u201d north of Rafah before the ground offensive begins. Those refugees will provide temporary shelter, food and water, IDF spokesman Daniel Hagari said. Netanyahu approved the IDF\u2019s Rafah plan on Friday.\n\nHowever, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington still has not seen a \u201cclear and implementable plan\u201d to safeguard civilians in Rafah. He warned on Tuesday that 100% of Gaza\u2019s residents are suffering \u201csevere levels of acute food insecurity. That\u2019s the first time an entire population has been so classified.\u201d\n\nNetanyahu has claimed that Israeli forces destroyed 18 of the 24 Hamas battalions in Gaza, and four of the surviving units are concentrated in Rafah. He told Israeli legislators that he reiterated to Biden the necessity of crushing those units. \u201cI made it clear to the president in our conversation, in the clearest way, that we are determined to complete the elimination of these battalions in Rafah. There is no way to do it, except by going in on the ground.\u201d\n\n\u2014\n\nOnline:\n\nRussia Today news agency contributed to this report, published by ORDO News editors.\n\nContact us: [email protected]\n\nOur Standards, Terms of Use: Standard Terms And Conditions.\n\nTo eliminate any confusion arising from different time zones and daylight saving changes, all times displayed on our platforms are in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).",

Kennedy Jr. filed their February disclosures with the Federal Election Commission (FEC). Joe Biden Only one of President Biden\u2019s political committees reported on March 20, but that single body held far more cash at the end of February than any other major candidate\u2019s main committee.\n\nPresident Biden\u2019s principal campaign committee, Biden For President, according to its FEC filing, held more than $71 million in cash on hand at the end of February.\n\nThe same organization raised about $21.3 million in total receipts and made about $6.3 million in total disbursements.\n\nSignificant parts of the Biden financial apparatus report on a quarterly basis, so the full extent of the president\u2019s fundraising is not clear as of March 20.\n\nHowever, Biden For President has issued press releases saying the campaign, as a whole, raised $53 million in February and has access to more than $155 million in cash.\n\nPresident Biden\u2019s reelection effort was buoyed by a $120 million commitment from the progressive political group League of Conservation Voters on March 19, too.\n\nIn addition, on March 12, Republican Voters Against Trump pledged to spend $50 million in President Biden\u2019s favor. The group is financed by Democratic Party donors and Republican critics of President Trump.\n\nThe full size of President Biden\u2019s war chest will be known in April when the numerous committees tied to him file quarterly financial disclosures with the FEC. Donald Trump Three committees funding the Trump campaign raised about $28.7 million in February, according to the FEC.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s principal campaign committee, Donald J. Trump For President 2024 Inc., his qualified leadership political action committee, Save America, and a super PAC, Make America Great Again Inc., held about $63.1 million at the end of February.

President Trump is now the GOP\u2019s presumptive nominee.\n\nPresident Trump scored another political victory in March when the Republican National Committee picked Michael Whatley and Lara Trump as its new co-chairs. The new leadership has promised to operate as an extension of the Trump campaign\n\nNevertheless, the Trump campaign is spending heavily on defending the candidate in numerous legal proceedings across the country.\n\nAccording to FEC filings, the three committees that reported their February activities dropped more than $6.5 million on legal expenses during the month.\n\nPresident Trump will likely continue to face legal and financial hurdles as the cases against him progress. He\u2019s currently staring down a $464 million bond in order to appeal a decision in New York.\n\nLike President Biden, only a portion of the Trump campaign\u2019s finances were revealed on March 20. The rest of the committees regulated by the FEC connected to President Trump will issue quarterly disclosures in the middle of April. Robert F.

Get all the news you need in your inbox each morning.\n\nLike clockwork, what follows Trump news is Trump noise. He hurls insults at judges, prosecutors, investigators and their agencies as he pushes back in an ugly, unprecedented fashion to pump up his already angry-at-America base of supporters.\n\nIf we faced criminal charges, we know it would not help our defense if we insulted or threatened that very same criminal justice system.\n\nTrump isn\u2019t entirely wrong\n\nYet Trump says that he is the victim of a witch hunt by Democrats and his enemies, that he is suffering like Alexei Navalny, just like Jesus, just like Black people.\n\nIt\u2019s a ludicrous assertion.\n\nBut he\u2019s not entirely wrong. The legal system is sometimes unfair, but not in the ways Trump suggests \u2013 and not to Trump and people like him.\n\n\u2018You are going to pay the price\u2019: DeSantis sends state troopers to halt Florida spring break crime. What about Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago?\n\nConsider that Trump has bought and will continue to buy the best available defense \u2013 with $50 million in legal fees \u2013 and what that says about the stark contrast between Trump and those who are struggling and must accept whatever the justice system throws at them.\n\nWith money and influence, the usual lawful process can be delayed, compromised or crushed along the way.\n\nWithout money and influence, Americans facing criminal charges crimes often lose the game they are forced to play. They\u2019re walking into a meat grinder, almost always represented by struggling, inexperienced court-appointed lawyers without the finances to support a good defense.\n\nThere is plenty of evidence that more often than we\u2019d like to think, the truly innocent have gone to prison for crimes they didn\u2019t commit, and not because of politics.\n\nSince 1989, nearly 3,500 Americans have been exonerated, according to the National Registry of Exonerations, after serving more than 31,000 years for crimes they did not commit. Those numbers clearly indicate, and I think most of us would agree, that we have a broken criminal justice system in need of reform.\n\nTo understand true legal persecution, look no further than less-privileged Michigan citizens like Temujin Kensu, formerly known as Fredrick Freeman, and Detroit native Ray Gray.\n\nEstimated 25,000 to 30,000 people wrongfully imprisoned\n\nKensu and Gray are among the estimated 25,000 to 30,000 people condemned to lengthy U.S. prison sentences for crimes there is ample reason to believe they did not commit.

But he was convicted by a jury when the prosecutor, Robert Cleland, presented without any proof a theory that the man with no money, a pregnant girlfriend, no job and living on food stamps chartered a plane to travel 450 miles to commit the murder and return undetected.\n\nWhen Kensu convinced the federal court that mistakes and harmful acts by the prosecutor, his drug-addicted lawyer and corrupt cops meant he should be released or be granted a new trial, an appeals court decided federal Judge Denise Page Hood\u2019s ruling didn\u2019t count.

Gray was in prison for 48 years for the fatal shooting of a man in Detroit in 1973. He has long maintained his innocence and provided new evidence in March, 2021. Gray was not exonerated, but prosecutors agreed to drop the conviction in exchange for a no-contest plea to second-degree murder. He was sentenced to time served.\n\nWrongfully convicted deserve protection and help\n\nThe wrongfully convicted and their families have been awarded billions in compensation for their suffering through judgments or state-mandated payouts. Imagine what the cost to communities would be if the nation recognized and paid damages to all the known victims of the justice system\u2019s shortcomings.\n\nUnjust actions in the criminal justice system have left many wondering why the Constitution didn\u2019t fulfill its promise to them.\n\nLast year, the right-wing majority of Trump\u2019s Supreme Court, led by Justice Clarence Thomas, stacked with a right-wing majority, again slammed the door on innocence claims.

            "text": "Guest post by Joe Hoft at JoeHoft.com \u2013 republished with permission.\n\nDeep State expert Michael Benz says Hunter Biden is untouchable because he was working on a CIA project in Ukraine.\n\nIs this also why President Trump was tied to Russia and impeached for looking into the Biden family\u2019s actions and illicit deals with Ukraine?\n\nMichael Benz unloaded some incredible facts about the deep State recently in an interview with Tucker Carlson.\n\nThen, Mike Benz reported that the CIA was heavily involved in Ukraine. This was in response to a report from the New York Times showing that the CIA was all over Ukraine.\n\nOn Thursday night, Benz released a new video clip arguing that that Hunter Biden was advancing a CIA project in Ukraine to swing the natural gas market towards NATO and that\u2019s why he\u2019s untouchable.\n\nHere is the transcript from the video on X.\n\nMike Benz: I just have to break this down in a video to make it perfectly plain and clear to people what\u2019s happening with Hunter Biden and the CIA. Why was I saying a year and a half ago that the reason Hunter Biden is untouchable by the Justice Department is because he was part of a CIA operation. Multiple ones, actually.\n\nYou have to understand what\u2019s going on here. Let me just give you a dozen data points on Hunter Biden CIA. The first thing is, Hunter was on the Chairman\u2019s Advisory Board of the National Democratic Institute, the NDI. The NDI is the DNC wing of the National Endowment for Democracy, which is the top CIA cutout used in our tens of thousands of NGO swarms. NED ranks number one. It was created to be the NGO affiliate of the CIA. It was created to do overtly what the CIA was doing covertly and getting in trouble for doing in the 20th century, created under the Reagan administration in 1983. There\u2019s something called the NDI for Democrats and the for Republicans, the CIA wing of the Republican Party. They both split spoils, basically on US foreign policy jobs that the CIA orchestrates.\n\nYou don\u2019t get to be part of the chairman\u2019s advisory committee of the NDI unless you are CIA-linked or CIA-vetted. It is a CIA. \u2013 NGOs, government-organized, non-governmental organizations. This is a CIA-organize a CIA-organized, non-CIA organization. It\u2019s the CIA. He\u2019s on the chairman\u2019s advisory board of that. By the way, when he was at Burisma, who was the other person on the Barisma board from the US there was Cofer Black, who had spent 30 years in the CIA. Cofer Black was Mitt Romney\u2019s Sherpa to the intelligence community during his presidential run in 2012. You know what? Mitt Romney is on the board of the IRI, who I just mentioned, the International Republican Institute, the CIA cut out counterpart to the NDI. Barisma was a CIA operation. Let me say this again. Burisma was a CIA operation. So was Naftagas. That\u2019s the public and then, respectively, the private and public natural gas companies there. There were a couple of other private ones in addition to Burisma. But the CIA was trying to break down Gazprom and swing the gas market from Russia to NATO. They\u2019ve been trying to do this for 16 friggin\u2019 years.\n\nIt\u2019s been an in-process CIA, State Department, Pentagon project for 16 frigging years. They were trying to capacity build Burisma and shift its board to make it US-controlled. They\u2019re doing the same thing simultaneously with Naftogaz, the feeder that Burisma feeds into. You can even read about the power struggle between George Soros and Vladimir Putin for control over Naftogaz, the state-owned titan that has been the privatization prize of the IMF. That is, that was part of the reason that we overthrew the Ukrainian government in 2014, is to privatize those assets because we knew that we were going to be cutting Russia off. So Western stakeholders wanted to profit from this trillion-dollar windfall if Russia could be kicked out the European energy market.\n\nThis is common activity for the Central Intelligence Agency, which was created by corporate lawyers in 1947 as its first class. The corporate espionage side of the CIA operation here has geopolitical dimensions. If you kill Russia\u2019s energy exports, you kill their military, which means you kill their ability to run air defense systems to Syria. You kill their ability to run small arms to sub-Saharan Africa to oppose US control over lithium and cobalt and copper and aluminum and gold and oil and gas there, too.\n\nThis was a long-range CIA project where Hunter Biden happened to be ass deep in exactly the number one geopolitical target of what the CIA was doing under the Obama administration, which is trying to kill Russia\u2019s energy exports. Meanwhile, you had this endogenous Ukrainian gas company that Hunter\u2019s on the board of. By the way, who\u2019s Hunter\u2019s dad at the time? It\u2019s Joe Biden, the vice President in charge of the Ukraine portfolio. But Joe Biden spent 30 10 years on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, 10 years rotating between chairman and ranking member. That is the coordinating wing of the Senate with the State Department and the CIA. It\u2019s specifically Central and Eastern Europe. Joe Biden was hugely involved in the Yugoslavia operation in the late 1990s, and breaking that up, which again was a CIA job, okay? That\u2019s why you have to understand the structure of the blob. Whenever you see the State Department, the CIA CIA is there and the Pentagon are there, and you just don\u2019t see it yet. Whenever you see the CIA, the State Department and the Pentagon there, you just don\u2019t see it yet. Even British intelligence is all over this LNG story.\n\nYou don\u2019t get British intelligence without US intelligence. The fact is, the CIA will lean on the Justice Department. I just did six hours of subscriber streams about the relationship between CIA and DOJ, and that the CIA will lean on DOJ to kill investigations into criminal activity involving assets of the CIA so that they can continue to do work that\u2019s in the US national interest, even if it\u2019s a criminal enterprise.\n\nBecause the CIA has a license to do that. They have the license to crime under NSC 10-2. They\u2019re licensed to do criminal activity as long as it\u2019s plausibly deniable. Hunter Biden was a part of a plausibly deniable CIA operation to swing the gas market towards That\u2019s why it\u2019s untouchable.",

Instead, the campaign visited East Palestine on the one-year anniversary of the Norfolk Southern derailment. The President vowed to continue holding Norfolk Southern accountable for their \u201cact of greed.\u201d\n\nRight around that time, the news hit that funding from the CHIPS Act for Intel was in flux and that the company was delaying the launch date for the Ohio chip manufacturing site.\n\nThings changed yesterday, though. The Biden campaign had a scheduled trip to Arizona to work the campaign trail. As I already pointed out, Arizona is the other site for Intel\u2019s manufacturing plan. That detail made it hard for the campaign to visit without acknowledging Intel.\n\nRemember, it\u2019s all about the politics this year.\n\nLong story short, Intel received some \u201ctimely\u201d news of $8.5 billion in direct funding, tax credits for the company\u2019s $100 billion investment, and eligibility for federal loans up to $11 billion.\n\nThe details are here if you\u2019d like to read Intel\u2019s press release .\n\nLet\u2019s get down to the rub.\n\nIntel shares are trading 1% in early trading, but the long-term prospects for the stock are very strong.\n\n(Click to enlarge)\n\nIt\u2019s not often that you get the opportunity to look at a company as it is transitioning into its future.

            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nFani Willis, the embattled Fulton County District Attorney, plans to press ahead with her goal of putting Donald Trump on trial before the November election, and intends to ask the judge presiding over the Georgia criminal case to schedule a trial date as soon as this summer, according to three people familiar with her thinking.\n\nIt\u2019s a bold move considering the hurdles Willis faces in getting the case back on track after a two-month detour revealed embarrassing details of her personal life, damaging her credibility in the eyes of Judge Scott McAfee and leaving her politically vulnerable ahead of her own reelection bid in November.\n\nWillis narrowly avoided being disqualified over her romantic relationship with lead prosecutor, Nathan Wade, who resigned last Friday following a blistering rebuke from McAfee, publicly questioning both Wade and Willis\u2019s decision-making. On Wednesday McAfee granted requests from Trump and his co-defendants to seek an appeal, meaning the threat of disqualification still hangs over Willis.\n\nGeorgia Republicans continue to investigate allegations that Willis benefitted financially from her relationship with Wade. A state Senate committee could use its subpoena power to unearth new information and plans to meet several more times to hear from additional witnesses.\n\nRepublican Gov. Brian Kemp last week signed changes into law that give a state commission the power to investigate Willis and authority to remove or sanction state prosecutors.\n\nWillis\u2019s rock-solid political standing has also been shaken. This month, Democrat Christian Wise Smith, a former Fulton County prosecutor and Atlanta solicitor, launched a campaign challenging Willis in the May 21 primary. Republican lawyer Courtney Kramer, an attorney who worked in the Office of the White House Counsel under Trump, has also joined the race.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the Supreme Court\u2019s looming decision on whether the former president enjoys absolute immunity from special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s election subversion charges, one that could affect various criminal proceedings against Trump. Any ruling in favor of the former president from the high court could be a major blow to both criminal cases against Trump related to the 2020 election, including in Georgia. Hearings begin in April, with a decision expected by the end of June.\n\nSources close to the Fulton County DA\u2019s office say the uncertainty of the federal case does not prevent McAfee from setting a trial date. Fulton County prosecutors said in a recent email to defense attorneys they planned to respond to Trump\u2019s immunity claim within two weeks of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, according to a source familiar with the correspondence.\n\nProsecutors believe McAfee can put the immunity issue to the side until the Supreme Court rules while, in the interim, ensuring the Georgia case is as close to ready as possible if the justices decide Trump can be prosecuted, multiple sources familiar with the thinking inside Willis\u2019s office tell CNN.\n\nMultiple sources close to Willis acknowledge the last two months have been a major distraction, one they admit was brought on by her own actions but also enabled, they argue, by how much leeway McAfee gave defense attorneys to attack Willis during the disqualification proceedings.\n\n\u201cBasically, this is a two-month sideshow that the judge should have not even let happen,\u201d one Willis ally told CNN. \u201cBut it\u2019s over and the judge finally came to the right decision \u2026 and so now we\u2019re back to where we never should have left, which is these people were under felony indictment. Let\u2019s get a trial date.\u201d\n\nSources close to Willis tell CNN that the DA\u2019s office is effectively ready to go to trial. Willis has said she needs only 30 days to prepare once a date is set. Defense attorneys have had since September to review the evidence and prepare their own arguments.\n\nWillis had previously asked for a trial to start in August 2024. Sources tell CNN she plans to re-up the request now that she has survived the chaotic two months \u2013 which saw the entire Fulton County DA\u2019s office face disqualification and threatened to derail the entire case.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear exactly when Willis will make her second request of McAfee to set a trial date. The Fulton County District Attorney\u2019s office has declined to comment to CNN for this story.\n\nAshleigh Merchant, the defense attorney who led the effort to disqualify Willis, was asked by CNN\u2019s Laura Coates on Wednesday night if the defense was trying to delay the trial until after the upcoming 2024 election.\n\n\u201cI would very much like to go to trial,\u201d Merchant said, adding that the defense has a right for a \u201cfair and impartial\u201d prosecutor to evaluate the case. \u201cThat didn\u2019t happen in this case,\u201d Merchant said.\n\nWillis and her team are aware of the political damage caused by the last two months but argue that their job is to prosecute the facts of the criminal case against Trump and his co-defendants, not worry about the political reverberations it causes.\n\nNathan Wade attends a hearing on February 27 in Atlanta. Brynn AndersonPool/Getty Images\n\n\u201cThere was definitely damage done,\u201d said former Dekalb County District Attorney Robert James, who watches the case closely and told CNN that even if Willis can get the case to trial before November\u2019s election, picking a jury alone could take months, especially with so many defendants involved.\n\n\u201cUltimately some of the prospective jurors that watched those hearings have formed negative opinions of the DA and this case,\u201d said James. \u201cIt was always going to be difficult to get a fair and impartial jury. The hearing on the motion to disqualify just made it more difficult.\u201d\n\nOne source told CNN that Willis and her team realize the damage inflicted could diminish the public\u2019s perception of the Georgia case ahead of what is likely to be a polarizing 2024 election. But that person also betrayed a sense of anger over the spectacle that was made of the televised hearings.\n\n\u201cYou have people covering this, frankly, like it was sports or politics,\u201d the person said. \u201cIt deals with political activity, but there\u2019s not an election going on in court. There are elections going on, but not in court.\u201d\n\nJudge \u2018rolling up his sleeves\u2019\n\nSince his disqualification ruling, McAfee has indicated he is ready to continue moving forward, with sources familiar with the case saying he has asked attorneys on both sides about how to proceed with pre-trial motions.\n\nRecent communications from McAfee include questions about which motions needs oral argument and what needs more briefing before he can rule on them, one source told CNN.\n\nFulton County Superior Judge Scott McAfee Alex Slitz/Pool/Getty Images/File\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s rolling up his sleeves,\u201d one source said about McAfee.\n\nThat\u2019s not to discount the fallout from last week\u2019s 23-page opinion from McAfee, which amounted to a highly-critical rebuke of Willis\u2019s actions, describing her relationship with Wade being the result of \u201cbad choices.\u201d\n\nMcAfee wrote that Willis\u2019s comments at an Atlanta-area church in January about the case were \u201clegally improper.\u201d\n\nHe also warned of the potential for a future gag order against Willis, but said her church comments were far enough removed from a jury trial that it would not \u201cestablish a permanent taint of the jury pool.\u201d\n\nMichael Moore, a CNN legal analyst and former US attorney in Georgia, questions whether Willis should even remain on the case, and says if she does, she will need to show McAfee and the public that she is in complete \u201ccontrol.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no question that the progress of the case has been impeded by unnecessary speed bumps and detours,\u201d Moore said. \u201cShe simply cannot afford another unforced error that results in additional unfavorable comments questioning her candor or judgment.\u201d",

            "text": "david03242024\n\nAmericans who did not vote for Donald Trump in 2016 quickly recovered from the shock of seeing him become United States president in 2016 by taking comfort in the thought that the country\u2019s democratic institutions were strong enough to withstand the autocratic assaults of this supremely narcissistic businessman-politician.\n\nThe belief in the promise of strong institutions lies at the core of American democracy. It means, among other things, that no one is above the law\u2014that the rule of law will prevail over any attempt by any occupant of the nation\u2019s highest office to subvert it or to use it for personal purposes. It means that the president\u2019s behavior will be subject to legal scrutiny like that of any other citizen, and that the separation of powers will be upheld at all times.\n\nThe reality, however, is that America barely survived four years of the Trump presidency. At almost every point, the new president seemed to delight in testing the limits of what he could do in his position. Yet, each time he opened his mouth, he only exposed his ignorance and self-centeredness. The COVID-19 pandemic bared the costly consequences of having an incompetent and whimsical political leader who thought he knew better than the scientists and professionals who were tracking the virus.\n\nPartly because of his administration\u2019s disastrous handling of the early months of the pandemic, Trump lost his bid for re-election in 2020. But it was a defeat he could not accept, for it was above all a blow to his ego. On Jan. 6, 2021, while he was still president, he called on his most rabid supporters to march to the Capitol Building to prevent a joint session of the United States Congress from proceeding with the formal certification of the electoral results that showed his rival Joe Biden to be the winner. The Jan. 6 insurrection should have spelled the end of Trump\u2019s political career. But that\u2019s not what happened. Just a few months after he vacated the White House, Trump was warmly welcomed back by the Republican Party leadership as though he had nothing to explain. It was the first sign that the party could not dispense with the demagogue who had done so much to undermine its stability and traditions, but who continues to be the party\u2019s number one crowd drawer.\n\nThe US is facing another presidential election. It will be a rematch between two aging political warriors, both of whom, for differing reasons, cannot seem to inspire confidence among the country\u2019s educated voters. Trump is currently ahead of Biden in the opinion polls by a couple of percentage points.\n\nThe likelihood of Trump returning to the presidency has become so real and so urgent that the venerable magazine The Atlantic, in its January-February issue this year, felt compelled to devote an entire issue to what it thinks would happen \u201cif Trump wins.\u201d At the risk of being seen as a partisan magazine, the editor justified its warning, thus: \u201c\u2018Of no party or clique\u2019 is our original 1857 motto, and it is true today. Our concern with Trump is not that he is a Republican, or that he embraces\u2014when convenient\u2014certain conservative ideas \u2026 Our concern is that the Republican Party has mortgaged itself to an antidemocratic demagogue, one who is completely devoid of decency.\u201d\n\nThe Atlantic spells out the bottom line for the American voter in the simplest of terms: decency. What this virtue amounts to basically is high-mindedness in decision-making and abiding respect for institutions. Biden can be accused of having a faltering memory, but he can never be charged with deliberately mocking the law, or, worse, turning the law into a weapon to be used against perceived political enemies.\n\nA good case in point is the investigation conducted by a special counsel on the classified documents that then Vice President Biden appeared to have brought home with him or moved to his private offices but failed to return at the end of his term as VP. Robert Hur, the special counsel, was appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland, a member of President Biden\u2019s Cabinet. Known for his competence and integrity, Hur happens to be also a registered member of the Republican Party. But not until recently did his political affiliation bother President Biden or his lawyers.\n\nThe investigation included many hours of interviews with the President, who warmly cooperated with the young lawyers that Hur had brought with him. This, in itself, is hard to imagine happening in a political culture like ours, where the president can always invoke more pressing matters of state to avoid having to answer questions from investigators.\n\nIn the end, the special counsel found no convincing evidence that would warrant indicting Biden for willfully retaining documents that properly belonged to the state. But rather than rejoice over this finding, Biden hurriedly called a press conference to take strong exception to the special counsel\u2019s side comment that a jury might, in any case, be inclined to dismiss any charges against the president\u2014\u201ca sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\u201d By referring to Biden\u2019s poor memory, Robert Hur reinforced the political slur that the president is senile and unfit to be re-elected. That small comment about the president\u2019s memory eclipsed all the hard work he had given to the case as a government prosecutor.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n[email protected]\n\nNews Related",

This was in response to a report from the New York Times showing that the CIA was all over Ukraine.\n\nMIKE BENZ: Of Course the CIA Is Assisting Ukraine in It\u2019s War Against Russia (VIDEO)\n\nOn Thursday night, Benz released a new video clip arguing that that Hunter Biden was advancing a CIA project in Ukraine to swing the natural gas market towards NATO and that\u2019s why he\u2019s untouchable.\n\nHunter Biden was advancing a CIA project in Ukraine to swing the natural gas market towards NATO & that\u2019s why he\u2019s untouchable. https://t.co/pDZZy2b0kV pic.twitter.com/TgL6hTZKRF\n\n\u2014 Mike Benz (@MikeBenzCyber) March 21, 2024\n\nHere is the transcript from the video on X.\n\nMike Benz: I just have to break this down in a video to make it perfectly plain and clear to people what\u2019s happening with Hunter Biden and the CIA. Why was I saying a year and a half ago that the reason Hunter Biden is untouchable by the Justice Department is because he was part of a CIA operation. Multiple ones, actually.\n\nYou have to understand what\u2019s going on here. Let me just give you a dozen data points on Hunter Biden CIA. The first thing is, Hunter was on the Chairman\u2019s Advisory Board of the National Democratic Institute, the NDI. The NDI is the DNC wing of the National Endowment for Democracy, which is the top CIA cutout used in our tens of thousands of NGO swarms. NED ranks number one. It was created to be the NGO affiliate of the CIA. It was created to do overtly what the CIA was doing covertly and getting in trouble for doing in the 20th century, created under the Reagan administration in 1983. There\u2019s something called the NDI for Democrats and the for Republicans, the CIA wing of the Republican Party. They both split spoils, basically on US foreign policy jobs that the CIA orchestrates.\n\nYou don\u2019t get to be part of the chairman\u2019s advisory committee of the NDI unless you are CIA-linked or CIA-vetted. It is a CIA. \u2013 NGOs, government-organized, non-governmental organizations. This is a CIA-organize a CIA-organized, non-CIA organization. It\u2019s the CIA. He\u2019s on the chairman\u2019s advisory board of that. By the way, when he was at Burisma, who was the other person on the Barisma board from the US there was Cofer Black, who had spent 30 years in the CIA. Cofer Black was Mitt Romney\u2019s Sherpa to the intelligence community during his presidential run in 2012. You know what? Mitt Romney is on the board of the IRI, who I just mentioned, the International Republican Institute, the CIA cut out counterpart to the NDI. Barisma was a CIA operation. Let me say this again. Burisma was a CIA operation. So was Naftagas. That\u2019s the public and then, respectively, the private and public natural gas companies there. There were a couple of other private ones in addition to Burisma. But the CIA was trying to break down Gazprom and swing the gas market from Russia to NATO. They\u2019ve been trying to do this for 16 friggin\u2019 years.\n\nIt\u2019s been an in-process CIA, State Department, Pentagon project for 16 frigging years. They were trying to capacity build Burisma and shift its board to make it US-controlled. They\u2019re doing the same thing simultaneously with Naftogaz, the feeder that Burisma feeds into. You can even read about the power struggle between George Soros and Vladimir Putin for control over Naftogaz, the state-owned titan that has been the privatization prize of the IMF. That is, that was part of the reason that we overthrew the Ukrainian government in 2014, is to privatize those assets because we knew that we were going to be cutting Russia off. So Western stakeholders wanted to profit from this trillion-dollar windfall if Russia could be kicked out the European energy market.\n\nThis is common activity for the Central Intelligence Agency, which was created by corporate lawyers in 1947 as its first class. The corporate espionage side of the CIA operation here has geopolitical dimensions. If you kill Russia\u2019s energy exports, you kill their military, which means you kill their ability to run air defense systems to Syria. You kill their ability to run small arms to sub-Saharan Africa to oppose US control over lithium and cobalt and copper and aluminum and gold and oil and gas there, too.\n\nThis was a long-range CIA project where Hunter Biden happened to be ass deep in exactly the number one geopolitical target of what the CIA was doing under the Obama administration, which is trying to kill Russia\u2019s energy exports. Meanwhile, you had this endogenous Ukrainian gas company that Hunter\u2019s on the board of. By the way, who\u2019s Hunter\u2019s dad at the time? It\u2019s Joe Biden, the vice President in charge of the Ukraine portfolio. But Joe Biden spent 30 10 years on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, 10 years rotating between chairman and ranking member. That is the coordinating wing of the Senate with the State Department and the CIA. It\u2019s specifically Central and Eastern Europe. Joe Biden was hugely involved in the Yugoslavia operation in the late 1990s, and breaking that up, which again was a CIA job, okay? That\u2019s why you have to understand the structure of the blob. Whenever you see the State Department, the CIA CIA is there and the Pentagon are there, and you just don\u2019t see it yet. Whenever you see the CIA, the State Department and the Pentagon there, you just don\u2019t see it yet. Even British intelligence is all over this LNG story.\n\nYou don\u2019t get British intelligence without US intelligence. The fact is, the CIA will lean on the Justice Department. I just did six hours of subscriber streams about the relationship between CIA and DOJ, and that the CIA will lean on DOJ to kill investigations into criminal activity involving assets of the CIA so that they can continue to do work that\u2019s in the US national interest, even if it\u2019s a criminal enterprise.\n\nBecause the CIA has a license to do that. They have the license to crime under NSC 10-2. They\u2019re licensed to do criminal activity as long as it\u2019s plausibly deniable.

After the tour, Harris delivered a speech pushing legislation on gun control.\n\n\u201cYou know, part of what I talk to families about is the fact that one of five families in America has a family member that has died because of gun violence,\u201d Harris said, according to Fox News. \u201cThat the leading cause of death for the children of America is gun violence.\u201d\n\nA report from Pew Research last year found that gun-related deaths among teens jumped by about 50% between 2019 and 2021. One expert said that the data suggested that the rise in gun deaths is closely tied to an increase in juvenile crime during the COVID pandemic and lockdowns.\n\nHarris did not discuss the impact of lockdown policies but instead focused on firearms and echoed President Joe Biden\u2019s calls for an assault weapons ban and other gun control measures. She also promoted a new office, the National Extreme Risk Protection Order Resource Center, to aid states that have passed red flag laws. The Department of Justice announced the launch of the center on Saturday morning.\n\n\u201cWe have to understand the facets of this and when we do reflect and review and, dare I say, study what happened here at Stoneman Douglas, we must be willing to have the courage to say that on every level, whether you talk about changing laws or changing practices and locales, that we must do better,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cOf the 21 that have passed red flag laws, I challenge the others to come on over,\u201d Harris said. \u201cWe got some resources for you to help you implement the work that you have done that has been the work of a leader on this tragic issue.\u201d\n\nIn general, red flag laws authorize courts to temporarily restrict a person\u2019s access to firearms after receiving a complaint about the individual\u2019s mental state or concerns that the person may have violent tendencies.\n\nAccording to the White House, the Biden administration has allocated $750 million toward funding red flag law programs, crisis intervention programs, mental health courts, and other state-level actions. The Department of Justice has awarded just $238 million of the funds since 2021.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE DAILYWIRE+ APP\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, the presumed Republican candidate against Biden in 2024, promised in a speech last month to roll back Biden\u2019s actions on firearms.\n\n\u201cEvery single Biden attack on gun owners and manufacturers will be terminated on my very first week back in office, perhaps my first day,\u201d Trump told the crowd at a National Rifle Association event.\n\nRELATED: DOJ Launches National \u2018Resource Center\u2019 To Aid Authorities In Taking Firearms From People Deemed \u2018Threat To Themselves Or Others\u2019",

He took jabs at Democrats like Sen. Elizabeth Warren as \"Pocahontas\" and Sen. Majority Leader \"Cryin'\" Chuck Schumer and Speaker of the House \"Crazy Nancy\" Pelosi.\n\nHe called his 2016 presidential opponent \"Crooked Hillary\" and then, in 2020, called Biden, \"Crazy Joe.\"\n\nBIDEN SAYS $1.2T SPENDING PACKAGE IS \u2018GOOD NEWS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE,\u2019 BUT CONGRESS\u2019 WORK ISN\u2019T OVER\n\nThe Biden camp distributed an email this week calling the president's opponent \"Broke Don\" \u2013 a reference to Trump's financial troubles.

            "text": "By: James Brooks, Alaska Beacon\n\nRinged seal, Pusa hispida, (c) National Marine Mammal Laboratory/NOAA\n\nA former oil and gas attorney appointed to the federal bench by former President Donald Trump said Wednesday that current trends show no signs that humans will be able to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions to avoid a major increase to global temperatures later this century.\n\nAlaska U.S. District Court Judge Joshua Kindred reached that conclusion in an 18-page order denying a request by the state of Alaska and North Slope Borough to remove the Arctic ringed seal from the Endangered Species List.\n\nThough the seal is common in waters near Arctic Alaska, its future survival is threatened by warming conditions caused by manmade climate change.\n\nThe state and borough sued the National Marine Fisheries Service in 2022 after the agency turned down their petition to remove the ringed seal from the list.\n\nFederal protections for endangered species in the Arctic have curtailed oil and gas development in northern Alaska, and state officials have repeatedly sought to remove those protections in order to allow development that they say is important to the state\u2019s economic health.\n\nIn their suit, state attorneys said that the federal agency improperly excluded an optimistic climate-change scenario known as RCP 2.6 when considering the delisting petition.\n\nThe plaintiffs also argued that a failed listing petition for Arctic walrus should have acted as a guide for delisting the seal, and that failures to properly analyze biological data resulted in a flawed decision by the National Marine Fisheries Service.\n\nKindred concluded otherwise, rejecting all of the state\u2019s arguments. On the climate change issue, he wrote, \u201cBecause current trends indicate there will be continued high GHG emissions and the (lawsuit) provided no evidence to support a dramatic, worldwide shift in emissions contemplated in RCP 2.6, it was reasonable for NMFS to remove RCP 2.6 from consideration.\u201d\n\nOn the walrus issue, Kindred agreed with federal biologists\u2019 assertion that ringed seals are more vulnerable to climate change than the walrus because young seals rely on snow insulation to keep from freezing. As the climate warms, that snow cover is expected to dwindle.\n\nIn a written statement, Alaska Department of Fish and Game Commissioner Doug Vincent-Lang said he was disappointed with Kindred\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cAlthough we haven\u2019t decided on next steps as we continue to review the decision, we are shocked that the court appears to be applying a higher threshold for delisting of species than for listing species. There is no differentiation in the law, and the state continues to believe that NMFS should allow the process to play out and do a thorough evaluation of species that are shown to have healthy populations,\u201d he said. \u201cIt also subverts the original purpose of the Endangered Species Act, which was to truly protect species that were on the brink of extinction\u2014now it is being used as a weapon to stop development despite no significant evidence of decline in the population.\u201d",

He was at the game stumping for signatures to try and land on Texas\u2019 November ballot as an independent presidential candidate.\n\nIt\u2019s still possible at this point but immensely difficult.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not delusional. This will be very hard to do, but it\u2019s not impossible. My hope is to have Donald Trump, Joe Biden, and then Literally Anybody Else right underneath,\u201d Mr. Else said. \u201cI really want there to be an outlet for folks like me who are just so fed up with this constant power grab between two parties that has no benefit for the common person.\u201d\n\nPer the state\u2013an application to be on the ballot as an independent candidate must be submitted with a petition and both documents must be filed on or before May 13, 2024.\n\nPotential candidates can start gathering signatures for their petition after March 5, 2024. But there\u2019s a massive hurdle: the petition must have 113,151 signatures from registered voters who did *not vote in the presidential primary of either party in Texas.\n\nOther states have similar requirements and deadlines for independent candidates. So, it will be doubtful that Else gets this accomplished in every territory voting for the next president. His best chance is to apply as a write-in candidate for the Lone Star State and others too.\n\nIn Texas, a write-in candidate only has to register with the state, but hordes of signatures aren\u2019t needed for the secretary of state to accept their votes if a voter writes their name down in November.\n\nIn other words, Mr. Else has to become a household name overnight even to have a chance in the big show\u2013something he\u2019s aware of.\n\n\u201cWrite that name in\u2013we don\u2019t really have a \u2018neither\u2019 option on the ballot, and this fills that role,\u201d Else said.\n\nBut Else\u2019s candidacy feels more like a rallying cry against the current state of politics and who Republicans and Democrats are offering up to run the country.\n\nIn an ABC/Ipsos survey earlier this month, Americans were asked if they\u2019d trust Trump, Biden, or neither to better lead the country as president. 36% of Americans said they trust Trump to do a better job, while 33% trust Biden more\u2014and 30% trust neither.\n\nThat \u2018neither\u2019 group is the one Trump and Biden will be chasing after hard. People like Else.\n\nElse, whose name was Dustin Ebey before the name change, feels like his candidacy isn\u2019t about winning but sending a message.\n\nTo him, he wants voters who feel as he does to write \u2018Literally Anybody Else\u2019 as a statement of dissatisfaction.\n\n\u201cPeople are voting for the lesser of two evils, not someone they actually believe in or support,\u201d Else said. \u201cPeople should have the option to vote for someone who resembles and represents them, not the lesser of two evils. I reject that.\u201d\n\nElse was born in Fort Worth and grew up in Louisiana. He started off college at LSU but had to drop out and join the military because he ran out of money. He served in the Army from 2012 to 2018 and graduated from TCU with a focus in combined science, aided by military benefits.\n\nA photo of Dustin Ebey before he was \u2018Literally Anybody Else.\u2019\n\nHe worked as an insurance adjuster before becoming a math teacher. While in the military, he traveled quite a bit as an ambassador, singing in the U.S. Army Chorus.\n\nHe considers himself a centrist in his political beliefs, which is always ambiguous to many, but Else said he has beliefs from both the right and the left.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to read more about his stances on healthcare, the border, and the economy\u2013he has a website titled www.literallyanybodyelse.com\n\n\u201cI would love to get up on the debate stage and bring some reality to what\u2019s happening. I\u2019m there because both of them aren\u2019t enough,\u201d Else said.\n\nBut what happens after November? Does Else change his name? Do his students address him as such now?\n\nLiterally Anybody Else stumping for signatures before a Stars game.\n\nPer Else, his students still call him by his new legal name because he wants to keep politics out of the classroom. His license will likely resemble his old one if his movement doesn\u2019t gain steam.\n\nBut he\u2019s going to march toward November, nonetheless.\n\n\u201cWe have the responsibility to stand up for ourselves and say enough is enough. Let everyone know we\u2019re not hopeless,\u201d Else said. \u201cIf you want to accomplish something no one ever has\u2013you have to do something no one\u2019s ever done.\u201d\n\nAs a result,\n\nTulisa Contostavlos Leaks A Sex Tape To Support Mr. Literally Anybody Else\n\nFed up with Trump & Biden?\n\nTRASHY | SCANDALOUS\n\nTulisa Contostavlos Sex Tape\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Nine red and purple states have expanded Medicaid since Republicans tried and failed to repeal the law in 2017 when Trump was president and Republicans controlled both chambers of Congress.\n\nThree GOP-led attempts to repeal the law through the courts have also failed, including one backed by then-President Trump in 2020.\n\nSince then, GOP members have largely conceded that an ObamaCare fight is a losing issue and have instead focused on issues like crime, immigration and the economy.\n\nJust In News | The Hill Read More\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

            "text": "Topline\n\nHunter Biden\u2019s ex-business partner, Tony Bobulinski, a primary witness in the GOP-led impeachment probe into President Joe Biden, accused Democrats of lying to the media in an explosive House Oversight Committee hearing Wednesday\u2014widely viewed as a last-ditch effort in the inquiry as Republicans have begun to acknowledge it appears to be coming to a close.\n\nKey Facts\n\nIn his opening statement before the committee, Bobulinski accused Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., and Rep. Dan Goldman, D-N.Y., of lying to the media. He also alleged Hunter Biden\u2019s attorney, Abbe Lowell, has tried to \u201csmear\u201d him, while defending what he described as a \u201csuccessful business career\u201d following his time in the Navy. Raskin jumped in, asking Oversight Chair Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., if Bobulinski was subject to decorum rules, while Rep. Jared Moskowitz, D-Fla., reportedly shouted \u201ckeep going, you fool!\u201d Bobulinski, who worked briefly with Hunter Biden in 2017 on a company called Sinohawk, has claimed to possess evidence showing the president profited from his son\u2019s business deals in China, including a widely cited email that allegedly references \u201c10% held by H for the big guy,\u201d which Bobulinski has repeated claimed is a reference to the president. Bobulinski\u2019s claims have never been verified, however, and multiple other witnesses have told the committee the president was not involved in his son\u2019s business ventures.\n\nTangent\n\nMoskowitz wore a Vladimir Putin mask around the Capitol before the hearing to mock Republicans for spreading allegations about the Bidens that reportedly stem from Russian disinformation.\n\nChief Critic\n\nRaskin accused Bobulinski of making \u201chazy allegations against the Bidens for the first time at a press conference choreographed by the Trump for President campaign,\u201d he said in his opening statement, referring to the 2020 press conference in which Bobulinski initially aired the allegations. Referencing the possibility that the GOP could make criminal referrals to the Justice Department based on their findings, Raskin said \u201ccriminal referrals require evidence of crime . . . and the only crimes we have seen are those of the GOP\u2019s own star witnesses alike,\u201d he said, referencing Alexander Smirnov, who claimed Biden and his son were involved in a bribery scheme and was recently indicted by the FBI for allegedly lying to the agency.\n\nKey Background\n\nBobulinski testified before the committee alongside former Hunter Biden business partner Jason Galanis and former Rudy Giuliani associate Lev Parnas. The committee also requested Hunter Biden\u2019s appearance, but he declined to participate, with Lowell calling the hearing in a letter to Comer \u201can obvious attempt to throw a Hail Mary pass after the game has ended.\u201d The hearing comes as a growing number of Republicans have openly acknowledged the probe is unlikely to result in a formal impeachment of the president as it has not produced any evidence showing the president was directly involved in, or financially benefited, from business deals involving his son or other family members.\n\nContra\n\nParnas in his testimony before the committee repeated his claims that any damning information about the Bidens was the product of Russian disinformation, telling lawmakers \u201cevery person integral to this shadow diplomacy knew that the Biden corruption rumors were baseless,\u201d he said, accusing Fox News anchors and Trump allies, former Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., and Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., of \u201cpushing a false narrative.\u201d Parnas, who was enlisted by Giuliani to dig up dirt on Biden in Ukraine ahead of the 2020 election, was later convicted of fraud and campaign finance violations for funneling money into the 2018 midterms to help a Russian national gain interest in the cannabis industry.\n\nRead More",

Eine erneute Anh\u00f6rung im Repr\u00e4sentantenhaus bringt die Demokraten in die Defensive.\n\nDie f\u00fcr die t\u00f6dliche Evakuierung Afghanistans verantwortlichen beiden rangh\u00f6chsten Gener\u00e4le wurden am Dienstag erneut auf den Pr\u00fcfstand gestellt. Die Republikaner im Repr\u00e4sentantenhaus verst\u00e4rkten ihre Kampagne, Pr\u00e4sident Biden f\u00fcr das Fiasko verantwortlich zu machen. Die Demokraten ihrerseits beschuldigten Donald Trump, die Bedingungen f\u00fcr den Zusammenbruch der Regierung in Kabul geschaffen zu haben.\n\nChaotischer Afghanistan-Abzug der USA wieder aufgerollt\n\nDie pensionierten Gener\u00e4le Mark A. Milley und Kenneth \u201eFrank\u201c McKenzie, Berufsmilit\u00e4rs, haben unter beiden Pr\u00e4sidenten in leitenden Funktionen gedient. Sie sagten vor dem Ausschuss f\u00fcr ausw\u00e4rtige Angelegenheiten des Repr\u00e4sentantenhauses im Rahmen seiner Untersuchung des katastrophalen Ausstiegs der Vereinigten Staaten aus einem 20-j\u00e4hrigen Krieg im August 2021 aus.\n\nGeneral Mark A. Milley, der damalige Vorsitzende der Generalstabschefs, sagt 2022 im Capitol Hill aus. \u00a9 Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post\n\nMcKenzie sagte, dass das Pentagon zwar einen Plan f\u00fcr den Abzug aller US-Truppen, Diplomaten, B\u00fcrger und gef\u00e4hrdeten afghanischen Partner Monate, bevor die Taliban an die Macht zur\u00fcckgekehrt sind, ausgearbeitet hatte. Biden aber stattdessen beschloss, die US-Botschaft offen zu lassen und bis auf ein paar Hundert Soldaten alle abzuziehen - und damit Zehntausende in Gefahr zu lassen.\n\nThe Washington Post vier Wochen gratis lesen Ihr Qualit\u00e4ts-Ticket der washingtonpost.com: Holen Sie sich exklusive Recherchen und 200+ Geschichten vier Wochen gratis.\n\nEvakuierung durch Bidens Au\u00dfenministerium \u201ezu langsam, zu sp\u00e4t\u201c\n\n\u201eIch denke, der grundlegende Fehler \u2013 der grundlegende Makel \u2013 war der Zeitpunkt des Aufrufs des Au\u00dfenministeriums zur Evakuierung\u201c, sagte Milley. \u201eIch denke, das war zu langsam und zu sp\u00e4t, und das hat dann zu der Reihe von Ereignissen gef\u00fchrt, die sich in den letzten paar Tagen ergeben haben.\u201c\n\nDas wiederkehrende politische Rampenlicht auf die letzten Tage des Konflikts, die von Szenen grausamer Gewalt und Verzweiflung gepr\u00e4gt waren, hat die Demokraten gezwungen, sich mit einem dunklen Moment in Bidens Amtszeit als Pr\u00e4sident auseinanderzusetzen - w\u00e4hrend dieser gegen seinen Vorg\u00e4nger f\u00fcr eine zweite Amtszeit als Oberbefehlshaber k\u00e4mpft.\n\nViele demokratische Abgeordnete haben sich ihren republikanischen Kollegen angeschlossen und den Umgang der Regierung mit dem R\u00fcckzug kritisiert. Doch angesichts der bevorstehenden Neuauflage des Duells zwischen Trump und Biden stehen sie unter Druck, seine Position zu verteidigen.\n\nGerangel um Verantwortung f\u00fcr den R\u00fcckzug des US-Milit\u00e4r in Afghanistan\n\nW\u00e4hrend der gesamten Anh\u00f6rung versuchten beide Seiten abwechselnd, ihren Respekt f\u00fcr die Gener\u00e4le zu demonstrieren. Gleichzeitig wollten sie sie dazu dr\u00e4ngen, den Pr\u00e4sidenten der anderen Partei als die Person anzuerkennen, die letztlich f\u00fcr das Evakuierungsfiasko verantwortlich ist.\n\nDer Ausschussvorsitzende Michael McCaul (Republikaner) sagte, das Wei\u00dfe Haus habe sich geweigert, auf Warnungen zu h\u00f6ren, was in Afghanistan passiere, als die Taliban auf ihrem Marsch nach Kabul St\u00e4dte und Bezirke zur\u00fcckeroberten. Das Au\u00dfenministerium habe erst am 14. August 2021 zu einer vollst\u00e4ndigen Evakuierung aufgerufen \u2013 einen Tag, bevor die afghanische Regierung aus dem Land floh und Tausende von Zivilisten den Flughafen der Stadt in dem verzweifelten Versuch \u00fcberrannten, sich selbst zu evakuieren.\n\nDer Abgeordnete Michael McCaul (R-TX) spricht bei einer Anh\u00f6rung des Ausschusses f\u00fcr ausw\u00e4rtige Angelegenheiten des Repr\u00e4sentantenhauses im Kapitol der Vereinigten Staaten am 19.03.2024. \u00a9 Michael Brochstein/Imago\n\n\u201eWie das Sprichwort sagt: \u201aWer daran scheitert, zu planen, plant zu scheitern\u2018\u201c, sagte McCaul \u00fcber die Regierung Biden. \u201eUnd gescheitert sind sie.\u201c Er erstellte einen Zwischenbericht zum zweiten Jahrestag der Evakuierung im vergangenen August und wird voraussichtlich im Sommer eine endg\u00fcltige Version ver\u00f6ffentlichen.\n\nBidens Beh\u00f6rden waren nicht ausreichend vorbereitet\n\nEine Untersuchung des Au\u00dfenministeriums, die im Juni letzten Jahres ver\u00f6ffentlicht wurde, ergab, dass die Beh\u00f6rde \u201eauf h\u00f6chster Ebene nur unzureichend \u00fcber Worst-Case-Szenarien nachgedacht hat\u201c. Auch h\u00e4tte sie nicht ber\u00fccksichtigt, wie schnell diese eintreten k\u00f6nnten, nachdem Biden beschlossen hatte, Trumps Entscheidung zum R\u00fcckzug zu befolgen. Die Beh\u00f6rde hatte auch niemanden, der eindeutig f\u00fcr die Vorbereitung einer vollst\u00e4ndigen Evakuierung zust\u00e4ndig war, so das Ergebnis der Untersuchung.\n\nEin Beamter des Au\u00dfenministeriums sagte bez\u00fcglich der Anh\u00f6rung am Dienstag, die Beh\u00f6rde sei \u201esehr stolz auf die Arbeit, die unter unglaublich schwierigen Umst\u00e4nden geleistet wurde, um die Umsiedlung von US-B\u00fcrgern, Personen mit st\u00e4ndigem Wohnsitz in den USA und Afghanen w\u00e4hrend des Abzugs und in der darauf folgenden Zeit sicherzustellen\u201c.\n\nBeide Gener\u00e4le im Ruhestand sagten, ihre Ausf\u00fchrungen st\u00fcnden im Einklang mit stundenlangen Aussagen, die sie w\u00e4hrend ihrer aktiven Dienstzeit gemacht h\u00e4tten \u2013 ein Punkt, den Repr\u00e4sentant Gregory W. Meeks (N.Y.), der f\u00fchrende Demokrat im Ausschuss, zu betonen versuchte. \u201eHier gibt es nichts Bahnbrechendes!\u201c, sagte Meeks und forderte die Gesetzgeber auf, stattdessen die Gesamtheit des Krieges zu betrachten und nicht nur sein Ende. Die \u00fcberparteiliche Afghanistan-Kriegskommission, die letztes Jahr einberufen wurde, um den gesamten 20-j\u00e4hrigen Krieg zu untersuchen, wird voraussichtlich innerhalb von vier Jahren Ergebnisse vorlegen.\n\nExplosion in Kabul t\u00f6tete w\u00e4hrend des Truppenabzugs 183 Menschen\n\nBei der Anh\u00f6rung waren auch die Familien mehrerer US-Soldaten anwesend, die bei einem Bombenanschlag am Rande des Flughafens von Kabul get\u00f6tet wurden, als die 17-t\u00e4gige Evakuierung sich dem Ende neigte. Die Explosion folgte auf tagelange \u00f6ffentliche Warnungen der Regierung Biden, dass der Islamische Staat, der einen Ableger in Afghanistan unterh\u00e4lt, kurz vor einem Angriff stehe. Bei dem Selbstmordanschlag starben sch\u00e4tzungsweise 170 Afghanen und 13 amerikanische Soldaten. Dutzende weitere wurden verwundet.\n\nDie Republikaner Cory Mills und Michael Lawler kritisierten McKenzie und Milley daf\u00fcr, dass sie nicht die Aussage eines Scharfsch\u00fctzen der Marines, Sgt. Tyler Vargas-Andrews, beachtet haben. Dieser sagte, dass er kurz vor dem Angriff einen Mann in der Menge sah, auf den die Beschreibung des Selbstmordattent\u00e4ters zutraf, ihm aber die Erlaubnis verweigert wurde, ihn zu erschie\u00dfen. Vargas-Andrews, der bei der Explosion schwer verwundet wurde und bei der Anh\u00f6rung am Dienstag anwesend war, hat den Gesetzgebern im vergangenen Jahr einen emotionalen Bericht \u00fcber den Bombenanschlag und seine Folgen vorgelegt, der das Pentagon veranlasste, die Ergebnisse seiner Untersuchung des Vorfalls zu \u00fcberpr\u00fcfen. Es wird erwartet, dass die Ergebnisse dieser Untersuchung bald ver\u00f6ffentlicht werden.\n\nBiden: \u00dcbernahme Afghanistans durch die Taliban sei \u201eh\u00f6chst unwahrscheinlich\u201c gewesen\n\nMcKenzie und die Verantwortlichen des Pentagon erkl\u00e4rten der \u00d6ffentlichkeit im Jahr 2022, dass der Bombenanschlag auf den Flughafen \u201enicht zu verhindern\u201c gewesen sei. Der Abgeordnete Michael Waltz (Republikaner), ein pensionierter Offizier der Special Forces, sagte, er sei w\u00fctend, wenn er sich daran erinnere, wie Biden in den Wochen vor der Krise die Aussicht heruntergespielt habe, dass Afghanistan an die Taliban fallen k\u00f6nnte. In einem Fall, so Waltz, habe Biden im Juli 2021 gesagt, es sei \u201eh\u00f6chst unwahrscheinlich\u201c, dass die Taliban das Land \u00fcberrennen w\u00fcrden \u2013 obwohl die Gener\u00e4le privat davor gewarnt h\u00e4tten, dass ein solches Ergebnis schnell eintreten k\u00f6nne.\n\n\u201eMeine Einsch\u00e4tzung war damals: Wenn wir die US-Streitkr\u00e4fte auf null reduzieren w\u00fcrden, w\u00fcrden die afghanischen Regierung und die [afghanischen Streitkr\u00e4fte] sehr wahrscheinlich zusammenbrechen und die Taliban w\u00fcrden die Macht \u00fcbernehmen\u201c, sagte Milley am Dienstag. \u201eAber ich pers\u00f6nlich dachte, es w\u00fcrde im Herbst sein, irgendwo um Thanksgiving herum. Die Einsch\u00e4tzungen gingen weit auseinander.\u201c\n\nDas Wei\u00dfe Haus, das zu Milleys Aussage befragt wurde, zitierte ein Dokument, das das Wei\u00dfe Haus im vergangenen Fr\u00fchjahr ver\u00f6ffentlicht hatte. In dem hei\u00dft es, dass Biden bei seinem Amtsantritt einen \u201ebewussten, intensiven, strengen und umfassenden Entscheidungsprozess\u201c \u00fcber den Umgang mit dem Krieg eingeleitet habe. \u201eLetztendlich weigerte sich Pr\u00e4sident Biden, eine weitere Generation von Amerikanern in einen Krieg zu schicken, der f\u00fcr die Vereinigten Staaten schon l\u00e4ngst h\u00e4tte beendet sein sollen\u201c, hei\u00dft es darin.\n\nUS-Visa f\u00fcr evakuierte Afghanen werden knapp\n\nMehrere Demokraten auf dem Podium versuchten, die ihrer Meinung nach widerspr\u00fcchliche Haltung der Republikaner in der Afghanistan-Politik hervorzuheben. Sie wiesen darauf hin, dass die Emp\u00f6rung der Republikaner \u00fcber die Aufgabe von US-Verb\u00fcndeten sich in sinnvolle Hilfen f\u00fcr die zur\u00fcckgelassenen Afghanen und diejenigen, die in die Vereinigten Staaten umgesiedelt wurden, niederschlagen sollte. Die Verb\u00fcndeten waren w\u00e4hrend einer milit\u00e4rischen Luftbr\u00fccke, die 124.000 Menschen in Sicherheit brachte, gestrandet.\n\nF\u00fcrsprecher f\u00fcr Afghanen, zu denen auch f\u00fchrende Veteranengruppen des US-Milit\u00e4rs geh\u00f6ren, haben davor gewarnt, dass Tausende von Afghanen, die der US-Mission gedient haben, in Afghanistan verbleiben.

            "text": "A coalition of 16 Republican states, led by Texas and Louisiana, filed a lawsuit against the Biden administration, challenging its recent climate action pausing proposed energy projects.\n\nThe multistate coalition filed its complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana, listing President Biden, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm and the Department of Energy (DOE) among the defendants in the case. According to the complaint, the DOE\u2019s move earlier this year pausing major liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminal projects violated long-standing federal energy laws.\n\n\u201cBiden\u2019s unilateral decree disregards statutory mandates, flouts the legal process, upends the oil and gas industry, disrupts the Texas economy, and subverts our constitutional structure,\u201d said Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton.\n\n\u201cThe ban will drive billions of dollars in investment away from Texas, hinder our ability to maximize revenue for public schools, force Texas producers to flare excess natural gas instead of taking it to market, and annihilate critical jobs,\u201d he continued. \u201cI will not stand by while Biden attacks Texas.\u201d\n\nGOP LEADERS CONFRONT BIDEN\u2019S NEW CLIMATE CZAR ON KEY SECURITY RISKS LURKING IN GREEN AGENDA\n\nAccording to Paxton, the LNG export moratorium is unconstitutional, ignores the 1938 Natural Gas Act\u2019s \u201cpresumption in favor of exports\u201d and discards decades of DOE energy policy.\n\nIn arguing the alleged unconstitutionality of the policy, the states\u2019 complaint notes Article I of the Constitution vests Congress with \u201c[a]ll legislative Powers,\u201d including the power \u201c[t]o regulate Commerce with foreign Nations.\u201d Therefore, since blocking LNG exports can be considered a regulation of commerce, the DOE violated the Constitution, according to the lawsuit.\n\nTIKTOK ACTIVIST SAYS HE ADVISED WHITE HOUSE ON BIDEN\u2019S NEW NATURAL GAS MORATORIUM\n\n\u201cThe LNG Export Ban implicates an issue of profound national importance. LNG exports account for billions of dollars to the economy and thousands of jobs,\u201d the complaint states. \u201cThey also raise serious questions of national security. And this is an issue that has been the subject of proposed legislation and public attention in and outside of Congress.\u201d\n\nThe complaint accuses DOE of violating the Administrative Procedure Act which governs the procedures of administrative law. The states highlight that DOE failed to host any public comment period before finalizing its LNG policy without \u201cgood cause to forego the notice and comment requirement.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, the states argue the DOE failed to properly consider the Natural Gas Act and its provision that states the agency issue an export license before hearing from the public.\n\nDOZENS OF FORMER TOP FEDERAL OFFICIALS CALL ON CONGRESS TO STRIKE DOWN BIDEN\u2019S NATURAL GAS CRACKDOWN\n\n\u201cThe Biden administration\u2019s illegal attacks on American energy jeopardizes the livelihoods of thousands of hard-working Louisiana men and women, millions of dollars in tax revenue, and billions of dollars in infrastructure,\u201d said Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill.\n\n\u201cLNG continues to have an enormous positive economic impact for our state \u2014 especially on our hard-hit coastal communities, which continue to recover from a recent series of devastating hurricanes. Jobs like these grow the economy, reduce crime, and help address the out-migration problem,\u201d she continued. \u201cThe people of Louisiana are proud to power this nation. I\u2019m ready to fight for them.\u201d\n\nIn a surprise move in January, Biden ordered the DOE to pause pending permits for LNG export facilities while federal officials conduct a rigorous environmental review assessing the projects\u2019 carbon emissions, which could take more than a year to complete. The action was lauded by climate activists who have loudly called for such a move, which they said would help combat global warming.\n\nHowever, the move was blasted by industry groups, former federal officials and bipartisan lawmakers, who noted energy exports are vital for aiding allies in Europe and Asia. In the aftermath of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine two years ago, U.S. LNG largely filled the void left by Russian natural gas as U.S. allies sought to wean off Russian exports and punish the nation\u2019s economy, a plan Biden endorsed at the time.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",

Biden meanwhile spent $6.3 million in the month but Trump spent more -- $7.8 million.\n\nThose figures however don't show the complete picture for either candidate as filings from their various fundraising committees won't be made until April.\n\nBiden's campaign said at the weekend that it had raised more than $53 million in February, leaving it with a \"historic\" total of $155 million, which it said was the most by any Democrat at this stage in the election cycle.\n\n- 'Dumpster fire' -\n\nPerhaps the most worrying element for Trump are his giant legal fees, as he faces criminal cases including for trying to subvert his 2020 election loss and keeping secret documents.\n\nLawyers' bills accounted for a huge $5.6 million of the money spent in February by Trump's Save America political action committee -- money that could otherwise be going towards campaigning and TV spots.\n\nThe figures add to Trump's woes as he struggles to raise a $464 million bond to appeal a fine by a New York court for fraudulently inflating his wealth.\n\nThe 77-year-old now faces having his assets seized in a humiliating blow to his carefully cultivated image as a dealmaker and self-made tycoon.\n\nTrump cast the fraud case as a \"witch hunt,\" seeking as he often does to use the legal cases against him to whip up his supporters -- and get them to open their wallets.\n\n\"I'm calling on ONE MILLION Pro-Trump patriots to chip in and say: STOP THE WITCH HUNT AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP!\" a campaign message on Wednesday said.\n\nThe message was titled \"KEEP YOUR FILTHY HANDS OFF TRUMP TOWER,\" his flagship New York property that could be at risk from the court case.\n\nEarlier this month Trump managed to put together a separate bond for $91.6 million as he appeals a sexual assault and defamation judgment in a lawsuit brought by New York writer E. Jean Carroll.\n\nBiden's campaign described Trump's finances as a \"dumpster fire.\"\n\n\"Trump's filings paint a bleak picture for Republicans,\" Biden campaign spokesman Ammar Moussa wrote on Thursday.\n\nBut with a tight election looming and Trump leading Biden in key swing states in recent polls, Democrats will be trying to keep their war chest as full as possible.\n\nBiden will be joined at a fundraiser in New York on March 28 by Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, the first event of its kind to feature three Democratic presidents and among the most lucrative in party history.\n\nThe gala show is set to raise $10 million for Biden's campaign, with guests having to fork out $100,000 each to pose in a photo with the 42nd, 44th and 46th US presidents, NBC News reported.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

            "text": "Does Joe Biden have a little momentum? On the back of his fiery State of the Union speech, a robust economy, and, now, a handful of favorable polls, it sure seems as if things are looking up for the president.\n\nAnd if the success of his own policies and oratory has given him a boost, he\u2019s getting even more help from Republicans. Recently, both Trump and Republican members of Congress have generously (inadvertently) taken to making Biden\u2019s case for him\u2014grabbing the third rail of American politics with both hands by pledging to cut beloved entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Republican Study Committee rolled out its newest budget plan. It calls for raising the eligibility age for Social Security, a major benefit cut; overhauling Medicare into a voucherlike \u201cpremium support\u201d system, a privatization gambit Paul Ryan once pined for, ultimately to his own political disadvantage; and an endorsement of the Life at Conception Act, which was already under attack because it would severely restrict not just abortion but likely in vitro fertilization as well.\n\nPublication of this budget, by the way, is totally optional. This proposal is usually created as a forward-looking wish list, not a practicable charter. But there was nothing compelling the influential RSC to put out this document, particularly in an election year. (Also, the committee has other immediate, practical budget concerns, as it tries to put together a package to keep the government funded.) And yet, the RSC\u2014which numbers some 170 members, including Speaker Mike Johnson and his top three deputies in Republican leadership\u2014went ahead and published it anyway, putting some extremely unpopular policy proposals on the record. The attack ads will be functionally written with a simple copy-paste.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that, for years, Republicans have longed for cuts to social welfare programs. The one defiant exception to that group has been Donald Trump, who used to be able to distance himself from this stuff. He famously ran in 2016 as the only Republican presidential candidate resolutely opposed to Medicare and Social Security cuts. No longer, it seems. In a recent interview on CNBC, Trump seemingly admitted to being on board with the broader Republican plan of curtailing both programs, saying that there was \u201ca lot you can do in terms of entitlements, in terms of cutting,\u201d grabbing that third rail himself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose comments, predictably, led to criticism, and the Trump campaign tried to walk them back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the Biden campaign had already pounced. There is no point of comparison between the two candidates the White House would rather talk about. Trump\u2019s comments have already been clipped and circulated widely, and they will be a constant fixture of the Biden messaging strategy until November.\n\nNot on my watch. https://t.co/RAHjjUlGDa \u2014 Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) March 11, 2024\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMany of my Republican friends want to put social security and Medicare back on the chopping block again,\u201d Biden said in a campaign speech in New Hampshire. \u201cI\u2019m never going to allow that to happen.\u201d In fact, the White House has now pledged to increase benefits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s good reason the Biden camp is loving this. In an age of great polarization, polling on these particular policies is resounding and bipartisan. Data for Progress found that only 8 percent of likely voters support raising the retirement age. Of Republican voters, only 9 percent are in support. It is \u201camong the most unpopular policies we have tested,\u201d the polling group wrote in a tweet.\n\nThe Trump team\u2019s attempt to split the difference on Social Security and Medicare cuts, already a near-impossible task, is made even more difficult by the RSC\u2019s new vision. It\u2019s a similar dynamic with abortion bans: Trump\u2019s equivocation on them will be a harder sell with the American public now that the House Republican Conference has seemingly lined up behind a bill that would likely enact some sort of IVF ban nationwide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe conversion of Medicare to a voucherized, private market competitor is similarly unpopular. When Ryan, along with running mate Mitt Romney, championed it in 2012, the Obama-Biden ticket seized on it with glee. Attacking that policy became a fixture of the race and no doubt helped the Democratic president win reelection that year.\n\nSo, despite Biden\u2019s weaknesses, Republicans have now cleared the path for him to run on one of the simplest, most popular policies in America\u2014while embracing a platform reviled by 9 in 10 members of the Republican Party. It\u2019s the sort of advantage a presidential campaign can only dream about, and Republicans have dropped it in Biden\u2019s lap without antagonization.\n\nOf course, Republicans may be so confident about their election prospects that they feel no need to withhold their intentions to pursue radically unpopular policy changes come 2025. But there\u2019s a lot of this election cycle left to go, and voluntarily yoking themselves to something a lot of people would really hate is a bold choice.",

Ahead of the general election, donations to joint fundraising committees traditionally filter to candidates\u2019 campaigns, the national party and state parties, not leadership PACs.\n\nBut this year, donations to Trump 47 will first be disbursed to the Trump campaign, followed by the Save America PAC once a donor hits the maximum campaign contribution limit.\n\nAfter an individual\u2019s donations hits the limit to both the campaign and the Save America PAC, the Republican National Committee will receive funds, followed by individual state Republican parties.\n\nThe maximum annual contribution to a leadership PAC is $5,000. The contribution limit means that only a fraction of major donors\u2019 contributions would go toward legal bills, while a higher percentage of small-contribution donors\u2019 money would go to legal bills, rather than be funneled to the RNC.\n\n\"Save America also covers a very active and robust post-Presidency office and other various expenses not related to fighting the illegal witch-hunts perpetrated by Crooked Joe Biden,\" Trump campaign communications director Steven Cheung said in a statement.\n\n\"The Trump campaign, the RNC, and state GOP parties ultimately receive the overwhelming majority of funds raised through the Trump 47 Committee,\" he added, noting that just a small fraction of an individual donor\u2019s overall maximum contribution goes to Save America.\n\nTrump faces four criminal indictments for allegations that he conspired to defraud the U.S. by subverting the results of the 2020 presidential election, mishandled classified documents and falsified business records related to hush money payments. Trump has pleaded not guilty in all cases.\n\nHe also faces a slew of civil legal issues. He and his company were hit with a $464 million fraud judgment in New York, and Trump was ordered to pay $83 million in defamation damages to E. Jean Carroll for defamation.

            "text": "Atlanta CNN \u2014\n\nPassengers on board the Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 Max 9 that suffered a terrifying midair blowout in January have received a letter from the FBI saying they may be victims \u201cof a crime.\u201d\n\nAttorney Mark Lindquist, who represents multiple passengers that were on Alaska Airlines flight 1282, shared with CNN the letter that the FBI office in Seattle sent to passengers on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m contacting you because we have identified you as a possible victim of a crime,\u201d the letter reads in part. It also notes that the FBI is currently investigating the case.\n\nSee more\n\n\u201cMy clients and I welcome the DOJ investigation,\u201d Lindquist told CNN, \u201cWe want accountability. We want answers. We want safer Boeing planes. And a DOJ investigation helps advance our goals.\u201d\n\nAttorney Robert Clifford, who represents many family members of the 2019 crash victims of a Boeing 737 Max jet flown by Ethiopian Air as well as some of the recent Alaska Air passengers, said some of his clients on Alaska Air also got the letter notifying them that they could be crime victims.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m certain everyone on the plane will be getting this letter,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThe families of the Ethiopian Air victims should have also been considered crime victims.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the letters that went out to passengers, flight attendants aboard Alaska Air Flight 1282 have been interviewed by investigators from the Justice Department, according to people familiar with the situation.\n\nThe letters were first reported by the Wall Street Journal earlier this month.\n\n\u201cThe FBI does not confirm or deny the existence of an investigation,\u201d FBI Seattle\u2019s Public Affairs Office wrote in an email to CNN, citing Department of Justice policy.\n\nBoeing\u2019s potential criminal liability\n\nBut Justice opened a probe into the incident and Boeing in February, CNN has previously reported. That investigation carries the potential to upend a controversial deferred prosecution agreement that Boeing reached with the Justice Department in the final month of the Trump administration.\n\nTha settlement, which was criticized by families of crash victims and members of Congress, was over charges that Boeing defrauded the Federal Aviation Administration during the original certification process for the 737 Max jets. Boeing agreed to pay $2.5 billion as part of that settlement, but most of that was money Boeing had already agreed to pay to the airlines that had purchased the Max jets grounded for 20 months following the Ethiopian Air crash and an earlier crash in Indonesia.\n\nThe deferred prosecution agreement could have ended the threat of Boeing facing criminal liability for those earlier fraud charges. But the Alaska Air incident came just days before a three-year probation-like period was due to end, so the criminal probe could expose Boeing to charges not just for the Alaska Air incident but also the earlier allegations of criminal wrongdoing.\n\nBoeing declined to comment.\n\nSee more\n\nOn January 5, 171 passengers and six crew members boarded the flight in Portland, Oregon, bound for Ontario, California. Abruptly after take off, a panel of the fuselage called the \u201cdoor plug\u201d blew off, forcing the pilots to make an emergency landing.\n\nA preliminary investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board found that the jet, which was delivered to Alaska by Boeing in October, had left Boeing\u2019s factory without the four bolts needed to keep the door plug in place.\n\nWhile the NTSB has yet to assess blame for the missing bolts, it has criticized Boeing for not having the documentation available showing who worked on the door plug when the plane was at Boeing\u2019s factory.\n\nThe FAA has also found multiple problems with production practices of both Boeing and its major supplier Spirit AeroSystems following a six-week audit of Boeing triggered by the January 5 door plug blowout.\n\nSubpoenas from the Justice Department were also recently sent seeking documents and information that may be related to Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems and mentions the \u201cdoor plug\u201d that is used in the Boeing 737 Max 9s, according to a report from Bloomberg.\n\nBoeing CEO Dave Calhoun told investors last month that \u201cWe caused the problem, and we understand that. Whatever conclusions are reached, Boeing is accountable for what happened.\u201d\n\nThe development comes the same week Boeing said it will report massive losses in the first quarter stemming from the Alaska Airlines incident.\n\nThe losses will be in part because of compensation to airlines that owned the Max 9, which was grounded for three weeks after the incident. Alaska Air CEO Ben Minicucci told investors last month that the incident cost his airline about $150 million, and that it expected to be compensated for those losses by Boeing.\n\nThe other contributors to losses will be \u201call the things we\u2019re doing around the factory,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Brian West said on Wednesday, leading to slower production at its 737 Max plant in Renton Washington.",

(RELATED: Trump's Attorneys Drop Bombshell News)\n\nAccording to FEC filings reviewed by The New York Times, \u201cBiden's re-election campaign had $71 million on hand at the end of February, more than double the $33.5 million in former President Donald J.

Aside from overcoming new partisan laws that make voting more difficult, they need to overcome a chronic undercurrent of voter apathy in the U.S. However, now that communities in many parts of the country are feeling the impacts of climate change firsthand, voting rights supporters have a new opportunity to engage voters and encourage them to choose leadership on climate action.\n\nOn climate action, who\u2019s elected matters\n\n\u201cIt makes no difference who is elected president,\u201d is the reason cited by 53 percent of voting-age adults who decided not to cast a ballot in 2020.\n\nIn terms of the climate crisis, though, the differences are all too real. Former U.S. President Donald Trump changed the game with one stroke of the pen shortly after taking office when he summarily pulled the U.S. out of the landmark Paris Agreement on climate change.\n\nU.S. business leaders quickly allied with labor unions to advocate for the Paris Agreement and reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Ongoing federal programs also continued to support progress on decarbonization, despite the efforts of Trump appointees to the contrary.\n\nStill, without strong White House support for climate action, the U.S. lost a key opportunity to provide global leadership at a time of looming crisis.\n\n\u201cWhile the US now represents around 15 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, it remains the world\u2019s biggest and most powerful economy,\u201d BBC environment correspondent Matt McGrath observed in November of 2020. \u201cSo, when it becomes the only country to withdraw from a global solution to a global problem, it raises questions of trust.\u201d\n\nThe leadership pendulum swings both ways\n\nThat trust cannot be restored in a single election cycle, but the current administration took a giant step in the right direction. Newly elected President Joe Biden took office in 2021 with a focus on leveraging government resources and private-sector investment to accelerate decarbonization.\n\nIn a new analysis, Carbon Brief credits President Biden with implementing new policies that bring the U.S. closer to meeting its near-term goal to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, highlighted by climate provisions in the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nIn the analysis dated March 6, Carbon Brief notes that the Joe Biden administration has brought the country \u201cclose to meeting its 2030 target range.\u201d If Biden is reelected in 2024, \u201cemissions would fall to around 43 percent below 2005 levels\u201d by 2030, Carbon Brief projects, though existing policies fall short of where the country needs to be to reach net-zero two decades later.\n\nConversely, the alternative \u2014 a second term in office for Trump \u2014 would once again turn back the clock: \u201cIn total, the analysis suggests that U.S. greenhouse gas emissions would fall to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2030 if Trump secures a second term and rolls back Biden\u2019s policies \u2014 far short of the 50 to 52 percent target.\u201d\n\nBy way of visualizing the difference, Carbon Brief projects that Trump\u2019s second term in office would wipe \u201call of the [emissions] savings from deploying wind, solar and other clean technologies around the world over the past five years\u201d off the books, twice over.\n\nRolling back the Inflation Reduction Act would have catastrophic consequences\n\nThough advising that other variables may impact the actual results, Carbon Brief anticipates a negative outcome for a second Trump term based largely on his pledge to roll back the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).\n\n\u201cThe IRA accounts for the most significant part of the emissions reductions expected as a result of Biden\u2019s climate policies to date,\u201d Carbon Brief authors led by deputy and policy editor Simon Evans explained. \u201cThis has been called the largest package of domestic climate measures in U.S. history.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt offers incentives covering a broad swathe of the economy from low-carbon manufacturing to clean energy, electric vehicles, \u2018climate-smart\u2019 agriculture and low-carbon hydrogen,\u201d they added. \u201cRegardless of the precise impact, a second Trump term that successfully dismantles Biden\u2019s climate legacy would likely end any global hopes of keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius.\u201d\n\nThe shield of apathy may be cracking\n\nA newly published study from the University of Colorado at Boulder indicates that climate change already impacts voter behavior, providing some basis to believe that the Inflation Reduction Act \u2014 and President Biden \u2014 will prevail for another four years.\n\n\u201cWe find that climate change opinion has had a significant and growing effect on voting that favors the Democrats and is large enough to be pivotal to the outcomes of close elections,\u201d the researchers concluded. \u201cWe project that climate change opinion probably cost Republicans the 2020 presidential election, all else being equal.\u201d\n\nSigns of growing voter engagement emerged in the 2022 midterm elections as well. Business leaders who value both the environmental and the bottom-line benefits of the IRA can help make sure that it survives into 2025 and beyond by seizing the momentum, building on their voter registration programs, and keeping climate action front and center in the national conversation as Election Day comes closer.\n\nTina writes frequently for TriplePundit and other websites, with a focus on military, government and corporate sustainability, clean tech research and emerging energy technologies.

Daines criticizes Biden immigration policies\n\nSenator Steve Daines has criticized President Biden for the apprehension of a terror suspect at the border, calling the situation \u201cchilling.\u201d This incident highlights the ongoing debate over border security and the potential risks of allowing individuals with malicious intent to enter the country. Daines\u2019 comments come at a time of heightened concern over national security and the need for stronger measures to protect the border. The incident serves as a reminder of the complex challenges facing immigration policy and the importance of addressing security threats in a timely and effective manner.\n\nSteve Daines calls out Biden after Terror suspect apprehended at the Border: \u201c\u2026This is Chilling\u2026\u201d pic.twitter.com/tIb2Qojzxv \u2014 \uaabb\uaadd\u00ea\u0309 \uaabb\uaadd\u00ea\u0309 (@TheThe1776) March 21, 2024 RELATED STORIES\n\nRelated Story.\n\nIn a recent tweet, Senator Steve Daines expressed his concern after a terror suspect was apprehended at the border, calling the situation \u201cchilling.\u201d This incident has once again brought attention to the ongoing challenges and security threats at the border, sparking a heated debate on immigration policies and border security measures.\n\nRELATED STORIES\n\nThe apprehension of a terror suspect at the border is a stark reminder of the complex issues that the United States faces in terms of national security and border control. Senator Daines\u2019s strong reaction to this event reflects the gravity of the situation and the need for immediate action to address these pressing concerns.\n\nThe incident also raises questions about the effectiveness of current border security measures and the need for stricter protocols to prevent individuals with malicious intentions from entering the country. As Senator Daines pointed out, the apprehension of a terror suspect at the border should serve as a wake-up call for policymakers to prioritize national security and take proactive steps to protect the country from external threats.\n\nThe situation at the border is a multifaceted issue that requires a comprehensive approach to address the root causes of illegal immigration, human trafficking, and national security threats. While there is no easy solution to these complex challenges, it is clear that a coordinated effort from government agencies, law enforcement, and border security officials is essential to safeguarding the country\u2019s borders and ensuring the safety of its citizens.\n\nSenator Daines\u2019s call to action is a timely reminder of the importance of bipartisan cooperation and unity in addressing critical issues such as border security. In a time of heightened political polarization, it is crucial for lawmakers to set aside their differences and work together to find common ground on crucial matters of national security and public safety.\n\nThe apprehension of a terror suspect at the border also highlights the need for increased vigilance and surveillance to prevent individuals with extremist ideologies from entering the country. As threats to national security evolve and become more sophisticated, it is imperative for law enforcement agencies to adapt their strategies and tactics to effectively counter these emerging challenges.\n\nIn conclusion, the recent apprehension of a terror suspect at the border underscores the urgent need for policymakers to prioritize national security and strengthen border control measures. Senator Daines\u2019s strong words serve as a reminder of the gravity of the situation and the importance of taking decisive action to address these pressing concerns. By working together in a bipartisan manner, lawmakers can formulate effective solutions to enhance border security and protect the country from external threats.",

            "text": "Meet the surging \u2018double haters\u2019 who could decide whether Biden or Trump wins the election\n\nShow Caption Hide Caption Poll shows Trump leads Biden slightly, but many voters remain undecided An exclusive USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll shows Trump leading Biden slightly, but a large percentage of voters remain undecided.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2015 Jana Pender is no fan of Donald Trump. \"All his lies. He's despicable,\" said the 67-year-old retired casino housekeeper from Detroit.\n\nYet despite voting for President Joe Biden in the 2020 election, Pender is not backing him in 2024. She said Biden has \"blood on his hands\" for supporting Israel's war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.\n\n\"If nothing changes, I know I won't vote for Trump and I know I won't vote for Biden,\" Pender said. \"I just know I can't vote for either of these people.\"\n\nPender falls squarely within a group of voters known as the \"double haters\"\u2212 those who dislike Biden, the incumbent Democratic president, and Trump, the former president and presumptive Republican nominee.\n\nThis year, this group of skeptics is large and powerful. Double haters make up about 15% of the electorate, according to a poll this month by USA TODAY/Suffolk University, giving them significant sway in deciding the outcome of the November election. Other polls have found double haters make up as much as one-fifth of likely voters.\n\nThey pose a challenge for Biden as his campaign looks to keep the Democratic coalition united \u2212 amid signs of splintering \u2212 and not jump ship to one of the third-party candidates or sit the election out altogether. But double haters are also a wild card for Trump, whose divisiveness turns many of them off.\n\nThe USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll, taken March 8-11, found Trump leading Biden 40%-38% among registered voters, followed by independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy, 9%.\n\nTwenty-five percent of the double haters supported Trump in the survey, compared to 18% for Biden. About 44% of the double haters currently back various third-party candidates. Kennedy drew more of these voters, 21%, than Biden did. Green Party candidate Jill Stein had the backing of 7% of double haters, while independent Cornel West was supported by 6%.\n\n\"He would be top on my list of people to vote for,\" Sally Power, 73, of Pittsburgh, Pa., said of Kennedy. Power, who runs a nonprofit women's retail shop, doesn't approve of Trump's \"statements and interactions with others,\" but has concerns about Biden's age and capacity to effectively serve another term until he's 86 years old.\n\n\"I don't want to vote for either one of them, honestly. That's the problem. And I think I'm not alone in saying that,\" said Power, who voted for Trump in 2016 but Biden in 2020. \"I find both of them not representative of my views. And I don't see them as being representative of the country.\"\n\nWho are the double haters?\n\nIn the 2016 election, Trump performed 17 percentage points better than Hillary Clinton among the double-hater voters \u2212 who made up about 20% of the vote \u2212 steering him to victory.\n\nIn 2020, Biden enjoyed higher favorability marks than Trump \u2212 49% to Trump's 45% in October of that year, according to Gallup \u2212 producing fewer double haters. They accounted for only 3% of voters in 2020. But this year, 55% of registered voters have an unfavorable opinion of Biden, according to the USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll, while 55% also have an unfavorable opinion of Trump.\n\n\"I think they will end up being the key swing vote because they're the ones that could go third-party,\" said Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster who conducted polling for Biden's 2020 campaign. \"They are the ones that could decide to stay home. They are the ones that swing back and forth because they're not anchored by affection, they're anchored by disaffection. These are the voters who decided 2016.\"\n\nDouble-haters are composed of an equal number of Democrats and Republicans. Many consider themselves independents. They skew younger. Most are white but Latino voters also make up a sizable share. Double haters are among those voters who have lingering concerns about the state of the economy despite a robust jobs market, low unemployment and a booming stock market.\n\nForty-percent of double haters in the USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll said the economy is the most important issue that will determine their vote, followed by immigration, 21%.\n\nMany double hates are wary of Biden's age \u2212 even though Trump, 78, isn't significantly younger \u2212 and convinced Biden has been weak and ineffective in office. But they have a fear factor with Trump \u2212 what they perceive as self-centeredness, the constant drama with his court cases, his controversial statements that echo dictators, and his efforts to overturn the 2020 election.\n\n\"I think Biden's been an abject failure,\" said Robert Brown, a 35-year-old from Minneapolis, who works in marketing and advertising. \"Trump's a piece of s---, too. Just to be real.\" Brown said he's leaning toward voting for Kennedy. \"He's a third option. How many times do we have to pick the lesser of two evils, right?\"\n\nPeter O'Connor, a 26-year-old student studying strategic communications at The Ohio State University, voted for Biden in 2020 and doesn't like Trump. He is considering a vote for Kennedy this year. \"I've heard a little bit about this Robert Kennedy guy. He sounds interesting to me,\" O'Connor said.\n\nJim Meikle, 80, from Albrightsville, Pa., called Trump \"an egotistical maniac\" who cares about himself, not the country. Still, he said he will likely vote for Trump again, like he did in 2016 and 2020, over Biden, who he criticized over migration at the southern border, pushing the expansion of electric vehicles and his administration's rocky military withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021.\n\n\"You know, it's really a shame. We've got a population of over 300 million people in this country, and this is the best that we can offer to be our president?\" said Meikle, an 80-year-old retired manager at a sheet metal plant.\n\nCan Biden win the double haters back?\n\nIn a troubling sign for Biden, 87% of the double-hater voters in the USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll said they believe the country is on the wrong track. Only 11% said they approve of Biden's job performance, compared to 41% who said they approved of the job Trump did as president from 2017 to 2021.\n\n\"If you're Biden, you have to say, 'Hey, your memory is wrong, his presidency was awful compared to mine,'\" said David Paleologos, director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center. \"Or if you're Trump, you have to say, 'All of this boogeyman stuff against me, is unfounded. I was president for four years, the world didn't fall apart and people have pretty good impressions of what I did.'\"\n\nThis week, Biden started to embrace an age-old election question that Trump has posed: \"Are you better off than you were four years ago?\"\n\n\u201cI hope everyone in the country takes a moment to think back what it was like in March of 2020 - COVID had come to America and Trump was president,\" Biden told supporters Wednesday at a fundraiser in Dallas. He described a period in which hospitals were overcrowded, nurses wore garbage bags for protection, unemployment soared to 14% and the stock market crashed.\n\nPaleologos said double-haters' fixation on the economy presents an opportunity for Biden, pointing to growing optimism among Americans that the economy has recovered from the pandemic. Thirty-three percent of registered voters now believe an economic recovery is underway, compared to a low of 9% in July 2022.\n\n\"To me, there's an opportunity for Biden to do something that Hillary Clinton was not able to do in 2016, which is to either make Trump more unfavorable,\" Paleologos said, or make inroads among double haters over the economy. \"The fact of the matter is if the economy continues to rebound, that's Joe Biden's economy.\"\n\nLake, who regularly conducts focus groups with likely voters, said the Biden campaign must first crystalize the choice before voters when it comes to Biden and Trump.\n\n\"Do you want someone who you think may be a little old or do you want someone who you think may be a little crazy? And God knows where he would take the country,\" Lake said of Trump.\n\nYet that contrast alone might not be enough. \"Right now, they're headed to third party,\" she said, arguing it puts the onus on Democrats for voters to understand that the third-party candidates \"are not viable, and they may not be who you think they are.\"\n\nData suggests the popularity of third-party candidates is often inflated when voters are given their names in a poll. It's also unclear how many states they will make it on the ballot.\n\nYet even if Kennedy, Stein and West don't match their current polling in November, they could be major factors in battleground states potentially decided by a few thousand votes or less.\n\nUltimately, whether Biden can win over double haters mulling a third-party vote could come down to their perceptions of the economy. Lake said they must connect how the president's policies have improved their outlook.\n\n\"These are downscale voters who need steady progress,\" Lake said. \"They need six months of good news. So the most important thing for them is going to be what's the economy in May and June. You tell me what their perceptions of the economy are in May and June, and I'll tell you where they're headed.\"\n\nReach Joey Garrison on X, formerly Twitter, @joeygarrison.",

But there are a lot of people to do what I call, quote, the wet work, unquote.\"\n\nAccording to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, \"wet work\" is a well-known euphemism for \"work involving murder or assassination,\" and Breitbart noted that it references \"spilling blood\" while taking a life.\n\nCarville admits \"CIA term\" means \"to take a guy out\"\n\nRather than castigate Carville for his violent \"wet work\" rhetoric, CNN's Cooper let out a slight chuckle in response and smiled as he joked, \"It sounds like a mob hit.\" Carville replied with a smirk, \"Well, it kinda is but it's paid TV and stuff like that. But yes, it's a CIA term -- to take a guy out.\"\n\nReturning his attention to Biden and his re-election campaign, the longtime Democratic operative said, \"But he doesn't need to do the wet work. People like me and other groups in the party need to do that. He's not very good at it. I don't think people want to hear\" that from him.\n\n\"And he can -- he can cruise along at a better altitude, but this has got to be done and they've got to press this advantage right now while they have it,\" Carville added.\n\nTucker Carlson believes Trump's opponents will try to assassinate him\n\nThere are a few voices on the right, none more prominent than former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who have suggested that Democrats and the political establishment, having failed at all other prior attempts to politically and financially destroy, may actually resort to physical violence and assassination to ensure that former President Trump can't serve a second term in the White House.\n\nBusiness Insider reported in September 2023 that Carlson, during an interview with comedian Adam Carolla, warned, \"If you begin with criticism, then you go to protest, then you go to impeachment, now you go to indictment, and none of them work. What's next? Graph it out, man. We're speeding toward assassination, obviously.\"\n\nHe added, \"They have decided -- permanent Washington, both parties have decided -- that there's something about Trump that's so threatening to them, they just can't have him.\"\n\nThe outlet noted that just one week earlier Carlson had directly asked Trump if he was worried about assassination attempts against him, and though Trump seemed to sidestep a direct response to that question, he did point out that his partisan opponents were \"savage animals. They're people that are sick.\"",

            "text": "The ongoing debate between the economic and policy impacts of President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump has intensified as both sides claim superiority over the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic aftermath. Drawing on recent analyses and polling data, this article delves into their presidencies to shed light on who truly made America 'better off.'\n\nAdvertisment\n\nStimulus Packages and Inflation Dynamics\n\nUnder Trump's presidency, Congress passed two significant stimulus packages in 2020 aimed at mitigating the economic fallout from the pandemic. Similarly, Biden's administration pushed through another substantial package in 2021. While these efforts contributed to a strong economic recovery, they also played a role in the heightened inflation rates observed in 2022. However, with inflation rates seeing a reduction in 2023, the debate continues over which administration's policies were more effective in balancing economic recovery with inflation control.\n\nLabor Market Adjustments and Fiscal Implications\n\nAdvertisment\n\nTrump inherited a robust economy, and despite the pandemic-induced upheaval, average wages appeared to surge under his administration. However, this was largely due to a shift in labor market composition rather than genuine wage growth. Under Biden, the labor force has seen significant re-engagement, although inflation has dampened real earnings. Both administrations faced ballooning deficits, exacerbated by COVID-19 stimulus spending, yet neither has fundamentally addressed long-term fiscal challenges, marking this area as a contentious draw.\n\nEconomic Recovery, Environmental Policies, and Immigration\n\nComparing stock market performance, Trump often highlighted the S&P 500's growth during his term as a success metric. Though the index has continued to rise under Biden, Trump boasts a higher growth rate during his first 1,000 days. On environmental policies, Biden's push for renewable energy, notably through the Inflation Reduction Act, marks a significant pivot from Trump's tenure, highlighting a distinct approach to climate change and energy transition. Immigration remains a hot-button issue, with both administrations grappling with surges in undocumented migration, reflecting the complex interplay of economic conditions and policy responses.\n\nThis analysis underscores the complexities of comparing presidencies, especially given the unprecedented challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. As America heads towards future elections, the records of Biden and Trump will continue to be scrutinized, with voters weighing which administration truly made them 'better off.'",

            "text": "In perhaps the least surprising news of the year, Vladimir Putin has triumphed at the Russian ballot box and been enthroned for the fifth time as president. He will serve for six more years.\n\nHe will be 77 years old in 2030. According to the constitution, which he re-wrote to his benefit in 2020, he then could stand again for a further six-year term.\n\nAcademic rigour, journalistic flair\n\nTHE CONVERSATION....\n\nBULLSHIT WITH RIGOUR AND JOURNALISTIC BIAS... CAPS ARE COMMENTS BY GUS....\n\nThe West can\u2019t \u2018solve\u2019 its Russia problem. Here\u2019s how it should handle 6 more years of Vladimir Putin\n\nTHE WEST DOES NOT HAVE A RUSSIA PROBLEM... RUSSIA HAS A WEST PROBLEM: THE WEST HAS BEEN DECEITFUL, WARMONGERING \u2014 AND SECRETLY WANTS TO DESTROY RUSSIA.\n\nBY Peter Tesch\n\nWHY NOT 6 MORE YEARS OF PRESIDENT PUTIN?\n\nTo put that in perspective, Putin already has ruled Russia as president or prime minister for 24 years, or the equivalent of eight Australian parliamentary terms. In that period, Australia has had eight prime ministers and changed governing party three times. The United States has had five different presidents; the United Kingdom seven different prime ministers.\n\nIn contrast to elections in the West, where the outcomes are genuinely in the hands of the voters [AHAHAHA] and adjudicated by independent electoral commissions, Russia is different. As the former UK ambassador to Moscow, Laurie Bristow, wrote:\n\nIn Russia, the purpose of elections is to validate the decisions of its rulers, not to discover the will of the people.\n\nIN THE WEST, THE PURPOSE OF ELECTIONS IS TO DECEIVE THE PEOPLE INTO BELIEVING THEY HAVE A CHOICE BETWEEN \"TWEEDUMDLE AND TWEEDUMDEE\"\u2026 WHILE THE PENTAGON IS RULING THE ROOST\u2026\n\nPETER TESCH CONTINUES:\n\nPutin\u2019s jaded view of the West\n\nPutin now will appoint a new government. His picks will be intensely scrutinised for clues to a succession plan and future policies. Although he is a master of surprise, we should not count on Putin leaving any time soon. Only four leaders of modern Russia and the USSR have left the top job alive; the rest have died in office of natural or other causes. SO?\n\nMoreover, Putin\u2019s actions over the past two years have been directed at moving Russia from authoritarianism to semi-totalitarianism. The Carnegie Endowment\u2019s Andrei Kolesnikov has written persuasively of these tectonic shifts that recall the darkest years of Soviet Stalinism.\n\nPutin has explicitly presented his war of choice in Ukraine as a proxy for a wider, long-term conflict with the West. He believes the West is irresolute, in decline, and easily distracted and deflected. PUTIN IS TOTALLY CORRECT.\n\nFormer US President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201chave at them\u201d attitude towards US allies and partners, and the woeful Western vacillation over further military aid to Ukraine, will only embolden Putin further. Buoyed by his ritual success in this weekend\u2019s election, he will embark on further risky and provocative adventurism. HE WON\u2019T. PUTIN DOES NOT WANT MORE TROUBLES. THE WEST DOES.\n\nRead more: What can we expect from six more years of Vladimir Putin? An increasingly weak and dysfunctional Russia\n\nBULLSHIT. WEAK AND DYSFUNCTIONAL? THE WEST IS IN A FAR MORE WEAK AND DYSFUNCTIONAL SITUATION.\n\nConsequently, Putin \u2013 and the ideology of \u201cPutinism\u201d \u2013 pose a serious challenge for Western governments and policymakers who are genuinely accountable to their electorates, [DO YOU THINK VON DER LEYEN, THIS UNELECTED WITCH OF EUROPE IS ACCOUNTABLE?] the party room, the parliamentary opposition, a vocal and inquisitorial media [DO YOU THINK THE WESTERN MEDIA ASKS QUESTIONS OF ITS OWN RULERS?]and an independent judiciary [LIKE THE INQUISITION AGAINST TRUMP IN THE USA?].\n\nAs exiled Russian journalist Mikhail Zygar has argued, part of Putin\u2019s statecraft is directed at making common cause with ultra-conservative Western political elements to contest global \u201cwokeness\u201d, demobilise support for [NAZI] Ukraine, and dull resistance to Russian territorial ambitions in its neighbourhood. PUTIN ONY HAS TERRITORIAL \u201cAMBITIONS\u201d TO TERRITORIES THAT WERE UNDER RUSSIAN CONTROL AND POPULATED BY RUSSIANS WHO BEG TO REJOIN RUSSIA\u2026 FAIR ENOUGH.\n\nHow democratic governments need to respond\n\nPutin is well aware that the inherent fractiousness of democracy and the need to court the fickle voters hobbles democratic governments\u2019 long-term planning. THE WEST IS AS DEMOCRATIC AS A DUNNY IS USEFUL ON THE MOON.\n\nMoreover, our political culture is predisposed to wanting to \u201csolve\u201d issues. MOST OF THE TIMES, THE WEST DOES NOT SOLVE ANYTHING BUT CREATES MORE PROBLEMS. Sometimes, though, problems of the scale posed by Russia or the Middle East can only be managed, not solved \u2013 and then only through joint efforts with like-minded allies and partners. That requires persistence and resilience to rise above short-term politicking and the twitches of our \u201cinstant expert\u201d social media culture. YES WE ARE EXPEDIENT AND BULLSHIT ABOUT OUR ABILITY OF \u201cEXPERTISE\u201d\u2026.\n\nIt also demands constant investment in building and sustaining public understanding of what really is at stake, beyond the borders of Europe that were drawn in the bloodshed and misery of the second world war. DOES THIS MEANS THAT THE WEST NEED TO TUNE THE STUPID PROPAGANDA TO 11? UKRAINE WAS ARTIFICIALLY DRAWN BY THE USSR...\n\nThis is difficult anywhere, not least in the West, where we have had it comparatively easy for most of the post-second world war era. [DID WE HAVE GOOD LEADERS THEN?] We need stalwart and principled leadership now more than at any other point in the last 50 years. Most of all, we need ongoing serious and informed public conversations [YES! WE LITTLE BOURGEOIS ENJOY THE SPOILS OF FOREVER WARS] about what we value in and wish for in democratic societies, and the price we are willing to pay to attain and preserve that. WE DO NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR OUR VALUES, BUT ACCEPT THAT RUSSIA HAS ITS OWN VALUES AND DOES NOT WANT TO TAKE OVER OTHER LANDS \u2014 EXCEPT THE DONBASS REGION, AS WARNED BY PUTIN SINCE AT LEAST SINCE 2008, TO PREVENT NATO ILLEGALLY \u201cINVADING\u201d UKRAINE.\n\nRead more: Why the US and its partners cannot afford to go soft on support for Ukraine now\n\nBULLSHIT. MAKING A PROPER DEAL ISN\u2019T GOING SOFT, BUT RECOGNISING THAT UKRAINE 1991 IS NOT AN INTEGRAL COUNTRY\u2026 THE DONBASS WAS RUSSIAN AND IS NOW BECOMING RUSSIAN AGAIN.\n\nThat sort of discourse can be hard to generate in our politically rather apathetic society. However, it is vital when the institutions of our democracy are barraged by foreign information manipulation and interference designed to sow doubt and distrust and corrode popular faith in the integrity of our form of government. WE BULLSHIT FAR MORE THAN THE RUSSIANS WHO HAVE STUCK TO THE NARRATIVE SINCE AT LEAST 2014 IN REGARD TO UKRAINE.\n\nEspecially in Australia, we have allowed our already limited pool of Russia expertise to atrophy to near-extinction. It is well past time to re-invest, modestly but purposefully, in Russian language and associated studies at our universities. We need to boost \u201cRussia literacy\u201d and comprehension of a country that will remain a significant and disruptive player in the world. This matters to countries that matter to us. GREAT IDEA! YOU NEVER KNOW, WE MIGHT EVEN UNDERSTAND RUSSIA LIKE SCOTT RITTER DOES\u2026.\n\nWe should also honestly and critically assess the mistaken assumptions and indifference that at times have undermined effective Western policies towards post-Soviet Russia. However, we should not succumb to the propaganda peddled by Putin and his proteges abroad that Moscow is a blameless victim of Western perfidy and deception aimed at destroying the Russian state. THE WESTERN PERFIDY CANNOT BE GAUGED BY THE WEST, BECAUSE IT ORIGINATES FROM THE WEST.\n\nRather, as Australian professor Mark Edele writes in his recent book, Russia\u2019s War Against Ukraine:\n\nRussia never came to terms \u2013 either as a society or as a polity \u2013 with its transformation from a continental empire with global reach into a nation-state and a regional power. professor Mark Edele WROTE SHIT. The Kremlin is marketing Russia as an ally of \u201cthe Global South\u201d in resisting resurgent neo-colonialism and championing \u201cmultipolarity\u201d.\n\nWE HATE MULTIPOLARITY IN THE WEST BECAUSE IT CHALLENGES OUR GOD-GIVEN RIGHT TO DOMINATE (COLONISE) THE WORLD WITH AN ENGLISH/AMERICAN/JEWISH HEGEMONY\u2026\n\nThe Putin thesis is that Ukraine is a patsy of London and Washington, while Moscow is on the side of the formerly colonised. PUTIN IS CORRECT: WASHINGTON HAS CULTIVATED UKRAINE TO WEAKEN RUSSIA (THE AMERICAN ADMINISTRATION OWN WORDS). That argument is finding some ready ears, evident in the patchy support for sanctions on Russia [IT\u2019S NOT PATCHY \u2014 OUT OF 190 COUNTRIES OR SO IN THE WORLD, ONLY 15 OR SO ARE IN FAVOUR OF SANCTIONS,. We cannot assume our own Indo-Pacific region is persuaded of the wrongness of the Kremlin\u2019s claims. THE KREMLIN\u2019S CLAIMS ARE CORRECT.\n\nThe reality confronting us is that of a sullen and resentful Russia [NO, NOT SULLEN NOR RESENTFUL, \u2014 BUT CONFIDENT AND POSITIVE], convinced that history, morality and even divinity is on its side in a de facto existential war with the West. RUSSIA DOES NOT WANT WAR WITH THE WEST. RUSSIA HAS WANTED TO COOPERATE WITH THE WEST, BUT THE WEST REJECTED RUSSIA\u2026\n\nMoreover, as Bristow, my former colleague in Moscow, has written:\n\nwe would be unwise to assume that a rising generation of Russians will embrace a more democratic and pro-Western outlook.\n\nPRO-WESTERN OUTLOOK MEANS BUM-FIGHTS, RAMPANT ECONOMIC DOWNGRADE, SILLY LIES FROM ONE OR THE OTHER POLITICAL PARTIES, CORRUPTION WORSE THAN IN UKRAINE AND DELUSIONS OF GRANDEURS LONG VANISHED. NAPOLEON IS DEAD.\n\nYet, we must not turn away from those Russians \u2013 far from an irrelevant minority \u2013 who do not share Putin\u2019s view that the future of their country lies in the perceived glories of its past. The challenge is to articulate what a better future would look like for Russia, beyond confrontation, and to keep that alternative clearly in view.\n\nDO YOU MEAN THAT THE WEST SHOULD POLITICALLY INTERFERE INSIDE RUSSIA? WOW!!!!!!\n\nPACK YOUR BAG, \u201cTHE CONVERSATION\u201d\u2026.\n\nhttps://theconversation.com/the-west-cant-solve-its-russia-problem-heres-how-it-should-handle-6-more-years-of-vladimir-putin-225999\n\nFREE JULIAN ASSANGE NOW....",

            "text": "After Trump's endorsement in big primary win, Republicans mull how to handle him in key Senate races\n\nSome Republicans say they are weighing how closely candidates in key Senate races should embrace former President Donald Trump after his preferred candidate romped in this week's Ohio GOP Senate primary.\n\nThe GOP is on offense in red states like Montana and Ohio and purple states like Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin as the party hopes to wrest the Senate from narrow Democratic control in November.\n\nMany observers and experts have expected that Republican candidates in those races will need at least some distance from Trump, who has early polling edges but still faces dour approval ratings with the broader electorate -- and who had proved unable to boost some of his marquee endorsees to victory in general election races, like Arizona in 2022.\n\nHowever, conservatives now tell ABC News they are reconsidering after businessman Bernie Moreno clinched the party's Senate nomination in Ohio -- and surprised the polls -- in the wake of earning Trump's support.\n\nAnd while Ohio is not as narrowly divided as other swing states hosting Senate races this year, Moreno's roughly 18-point margin of victory in a three-way race, along with Trump's outsized presence on the campaign trail and at the top of ballots this November, is causing some Republicans to consider the feasibility of having candidates distance themselves from their party leader.\n\n\"No, don't run away from it at all,\" said one GOP strategist with extensive experience working in Nevada, host of one of the nation's major Senate races later this year.\n\n\"Of those states, [Trump] right now is polling favorite, a tossup at least,\" said this strategist, who asked not to be quoted by name to be more candid. \"And also, voters don't buy it. You're a Republican. You're running with the Republican. Everybody kind of gets it.\"\n\nThere is another dynamic at work: Unlike in some past cycles, Republicans in Washington have worked diligently in 2024 to pave the way for noncontroversial candidates to clear Senate primary fields, offering early endorsements and additional support while boxing out other would-be contenders weighed down by ideological and personal baggage.\n\nThe strategy marks a departure from the national party's more laissez-faire approach in 2022 when divisive and scandalized candidates were able to clinch the GOP nomination and then lose competitive Senate races like those in Georgia and Pennsylvania. And so far, it's worked -- the party's preferred candidates are either running all by themselves or against resource-starved opponents in Montana, West Virginia, Wisconsin and more.\n\nThis year's crop of candidates, though, will have to navigate running in a presidential year when the quadrennial debate over how tightly to embrace the top of the ticket is ramped up for both parties.\n\nRepublicans, including those around Moreno, eye his bear hug of Trump and subsequent victory -- and see some evidence that distance from the top of the ticket won't necessarily punch candidates' way to the Senate.\n\n\"Bernie won because he had Donald Trump backing him and because Bernie reflected Donald Trump's 'America First' worldview, which is the dominant worldview in the Republican Party in 2024,\" said one Moreno adviser.\n\n\"The party of George Bush is dead and buried. As much as that pains some establishment Republicans to hear, it's just the reality. Running in the so-called establishment Bush lane in Republican primaries is a death spot,\" this person said.\n\nParty operatives cautioned, still, that that proximity to Trump isn't equally popular everywhere and doesn't replace the need for a candidate to establish their own brand, a necessity in politics generally but also in a cycle when handfuls of split-ticket voters could make an outsized impact in November.\n\nBut on the flip side, establishing a brand too removed from Trump may not be possible either.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump greets Ohio Republican candidate for US Senate Bernie Moreno during a rally in Vandalia, OH, March 16, 2024. Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\n\"Every candidate, they're gonna run their own campaign. And that's always been the case,\" said GOP strategist Zack Roday. \"These candidates have to make a determination on what they're doing each day and every day, but they will be barnstorming these states, I'm sure the president will be barnstorming these states. I'm sure you'll see them together. And I'm sure that the campaigns will make a determination on what their emphasis is as we go into the really heavy spend period.\"\n\nMany Republicans have already made the calculation that tying their ship to Trump's is the best way to sail to the Senate.\n\nMoreno got a boost of attention among party voters by a late rally with Trump in Dayton, Ohio, days before primary voting. Kari Lake, the overwhelming favorite to win Arizona's GOP Senate primary, is such a close ally that her name was tossed around in the Trump \"veepstakes.\"\n\nAnd Tim Sheehy, who is virtually guaranteed to run against Montana Sen. Jon Tester, a Democratic, is touting his endorsement from the former president on the trail and running a banner about it at the top of his campaign website.\n\nOther Republican strategists, though, warn such proximity poses risks.\n\nPresidential primary results have shown Trump struggling to win back voters in the suburbs and among more moderate and independent-leaning blocs -- the same sore spots where President Joe Biden was able to run up the score in the 2020 general election, exit polling found.\n\n\"In a purple state, you do need to have some distance from Trump, because odds are you're going to have to out-poll Trump, and you want Trump to be your floor but not to be your ceiling,\" Chris Nicholas, a veteran Pennsylvania Republican consultant, told ABC News, adding that he \"would not put Ohio into the category of purple-y states.\"\n\nOther candidates have not distanced themselves from Trump as much as they've focused more on their own race.\n\nDave McCormick, Republicans' preferred candidate in Pennsylvania's Senate battle, has endorsed Trump's campaign but focused much of his campaign on knocking Biden and Democratic incumbent Bob Casey while promoting his military service, ties to the state and support for farmers, for example.\n\nTo be certain, Democrats are expected to have to walk a tightrope of their own given Biden's grim approval ratings, and drawing eyeballs to down-ballot races with such outsized personalities at the top of the ticket this year could be a struggle for both parties.\n\nAnd for all the focus on swing voters, Trump helps supercharge the Republican base, making an alliance potentially beneficial for down-ballot candidates, as evidenced in Ohio, where Moreno posted strong showings in key blue-collar counties -- precisely the kind of areas Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, his November opponent, has historically leaned on.\n\n\"Donald Trump is more popular than virtually every Republican Senate candidate,\" Moreno's adviser said. \"So Republicans push him away at their own peril.\"",

With a midnight deadline looming, Senate leaders beat back efforts by conservative Republicans to enact deep spending cuts and restrictions on migration.\n\nBiden applauded passage of the funding package, but also prodded lawmakers to approve assistance for Ukraine, Israel and Indo-Pacific allies that has been stalled for months, as well as a measure that would tighten security at the US-Mexico border.\n\n\u201cI want to be clear: Congress\u2019s work isn\u2019t finished,\u201d Biden said in a statement Saturday.\n\nNATO\u2019s top civilian official said last week that Ukraine is \u201crunning out of ammunition,\u201d echoing warnings by the country\u2019s allies, including the US.\n\nThe funding package increases defense appropriations by 3% while keeping overall domestic spending flat.

Please enter a valid email address.\n\nWhile House and Senate conservatives railed against the $1.2 trillion federal funding bill that passed Friday, as the de facto leader of the Republican Party remained silent.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, the GOP\u2019s presumptive 2024 nominee, made no public comments, and his campaign did not respond to multiple requests for comment on the bill, which President Biden signed into law on Saturday.\n\n\u201cThis agreement represents a compromise, which means neither side got everything it wanted,\u201d Biden, a Democrat, said in a statement. \u201cBut it rejects extreme cuts from House Republicans and expands access to child care, invests in cancer research, funds mental health and substance use care, advances American leadership abroad, and provides resources to secure the border that my administration successfully fought to include. That\u2019s good news for the American people.\u201d\n\nCongress avoided a lengthy partial government shutdown Saturday when the Senate passed the spending package 74-24 in the wee hours of the morning. The bill passed the House on Friday by a vote of 286-134, with a majority of Republicans, 113, voting against it.\n\nUS NATIONAL DEBT TRACKER FOR MARCH 22, 2024: SEE WHAT AMERICAN TAXPAYERS (YOU) OWE IN REAL TIME\n\nRepublican opponents seethed as the package moved through Congress, arguing that it did little to address the $34 trillion national debt, funded Biden\u2019s policies that they oppose and failed to include border security enforcement measures that GOP lawmakers had demanded in order to fund the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nThe final vote violated the so-called Hastert Rule, a long held GOP \u201crule,\u201d named after former House Speaker Dennis Hastert, that holds Republican leadership should allow votes only on bills that have a \u201cmajority of the majority\u201d in agreement \u2014 in other words, only if a majority of Republicans support them.\n\nThat outcome reflected deep divisions within the House GOP conference, with many Republicans expressing frustration at leadership for unveiling the 1,012-page package just 48 hours before lawmakers were asked to vote.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s total lack of backbone, total lack of leadership, and a total failure by Republican leadership. There\u2019s no other way to describe it,\u201d Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, said Thursday on former Trump White House adviser Stephen K. Bannon\u2019s \u201cWar Room.\u201d \u201cThis bill is an abomination.\u201d\n\nSENATE PASSES MAMMOTH $1.2T SPENDING PACKAGE AFTER BRIEF PARTIAL GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN\n\nSenate Republicans who opposed the package made similar complaints, with Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah., telling Fox News Digital that it was an \u201cutterly absurd, insulting and lawless suggestion that that is an appropriate legislative process.\u201d\n\nSen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., accused the bill\u2019s supporters of \u201ccaving to Biden & Schumer & voting for billions in earmarks and special interest giveaways,\u201d in a post on X.\n\nGOP firebrand Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., went so far as to introduce a motion to remove House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., from leadership, accusing him of betrayal. Other Republicans, like Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., said that removing Johnson would be a \u201cmistake,\u201d arguing that the speaker has done \u201cthe best he could\u201d with a one-seat majority.\n\nWhile Washington Republicans fight each other, Trump has not yet offered a clear vision for how he would manage these spending crises, were he to win back the White House in 2024.\n\nHOUSE PASSES $1.2 TRILLION GOVERNMENT SPENDING BILL TO AVERT GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN\n\nOn the campaign trail, the presumptive GOP nominee has insisted that he will pay off the national debt if he ousts Biden. But while Trump was president from 2017 through 2020, the laws and executive orders he signed added an estimated $8.4 trillion to the national debt, with interest, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB).\n\nIndeed, Trump was responsible for signing several trillion-dollar omnibus spending bills into law, even before the COVID-19 pandemic. Excluding COVID relief, Trump added $4.8 trillion to the debt over his four years in office, CRFB estimates.\n\nIn his first two years in office, when the House and Senate were in Republican hands, the Trump White House unsuccessfully sought to cut about $15 billion in federal spending with a recissions request. That effort narrowly passed the House and died in the Senate, where Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Richard Burr, R-N.C. sided with Democrats on a procedural vote to kill it.\n\nIn 2018, faced with a $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill, Trump backed down from a veto threat and reluctantly signed the bill, reasoning that it provided needed funds for the military.\n\nBIDEN SAYS $1.2T SPENDING PACKAGE IS \u2018GOOD NEWS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE,\u2019 BUT CONGRESS\u2019 WORK ISN\u2019T OVER\n\n\u201cI say to Congress, I will never sign another bill like this again,\u201d Trump said in remarks after he signed the bill.\n\nThe very next year, Trump signed a $1.4 trillion spending package to avert a partial government shutdown. He did so again as one of his last acts as president in December 2020, putting his signature on another massive $1.4 trillion omnibus that included $900 billion in COVID-19 aid.\n\nBut while Trump did not keep his promise to get federal spending under control in his first term, Biden is on track to exceed Trump\u2019s debt accumulation by the end of this year. In his first three years as president, Biden has added $6.75 trillion to the national debt, according to Treasury Department data. In his final year, the Congressional Budget Office projects a deficit of $1.58 trillion \u2014 which would total $8.3 trillion by the end of Biden\u2019s first term.\n\nThose estimates were made before Biden signed the new $1.2 trillion appropriations package on Saturday.\n\nBiden\u2019s fiscal year 2025 budget calls for $3.3 trillion in net deficit reduction, although the revenue that is needed to achieve that goal would mostly come from tax increases. Biden has promised not to increase taxes on those making less than $400,000, but he otherwise has called for a repeal of Trump\u2019s tax cuts and additional taxes on corporations and the wealthy.\n\nTrump has campaigned on new rounds of tax cuts, arguing that economic growth stimulated by lower taxes will make up for any loss in government revenue. But he has yet to tell voters how he plans to cut spending, or how he will work with Congress to break the cycle of last-minute omnibus spending bills that were characteristic of his first term.",

            "text": "Former President Donald Trump has intensified his attacks on the Biden administration\u2019s policies promoting electric vehicles (EVs), as the current administration pushes new auto emissions standards that bolster the transition toward electrification. Trump claims President Biden\u2019s EV agenda will result in a \u201cblood bath\u201d for the auto industry and the broader economy if Biden is reelected.\n\nTrump\u2019s rhetoric has targeted EVs across campaign trails, notably in Michigan, a crucial swing state and automotive hub, where he has sought to amplify autoworker concerns about job losses in the industry. This political maneuver is in line with his historical pattern of opposing EVs with often exaggerated or false claims. For instance, Trump erroneously stated that EVs could eliminate 40 percent of auto industry jobs and that they have a mere 15 minutes of drive time before needing a charge.\n\nThese recent pronouncements dovetail with the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) final rule that envisions a significant move towards EVs in the coming years. Under the new rule, automakers must ensure that by 2032, 56% of light-duty car sales are battery electric and another 13% are hybrid, aiming for nearly 70% of new cars to be zero-emissions or low-emissions. The Biden administration seeks EVs to represent half of new car sales by 2030.\n\nThe Trump campaign has been vociferous in its condemnation of these new regulations. \u201cJoe Biden\u2019s extreme electric vehicle mandate will force Americans to buy ultra-expensive cars they do not want and cannot afford while destroying the U.S. auto industry in the process,\u201d Trump campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News Digital. Trump promises to reverse these mandates on his first day in office, should he win the election.\n\nWhile Trump harnesses this issue as a political cudgel in the Republican primary, strategists like Mike Murphy suggest that the polarization around EVs, propelled by government mandates, may turn off swing voters, who may otherwise support local EV investments. Republican political consultant Keith Naughton points out that the \u201cbad news about EVs over the winter,\u201d including less adoption and slumping demand, might amplify Trump\u2019s message among swing voters in the affected states.\n\nIn contrast, Biden\u2019s policies, including the new EPA rule, are celebrated by the administration and environmentalists as a triumph for climate action. The standards are projected to avoid over 7 billion tons of carbon emissions and provide significant public health benefits and fuel savings. However, this progress is met with resistance from industry groups and Republican lawmakers who assert the regulations are unrealistic and will increase reliance on foreign sources for critical minerals.\n\nRelevant articles:\n\n\u2013 Trump amps up attacks on electric vehicles, a major Biden priority\n\n\u2013 Biden hits accelerator on car rule as foes plot roadblocks, E&E News by POLITICO, Wed, 20 Mar 2024 17:37:00 GMT\n\n\u2013 Trump campaign responds in force after Biden cracks down on gas cars, vows \u2018Day One\u2019 reversal, Fox News, Wed, 20 Mar 2024 19:47:00 GMT\n\n\u2013 Trump warns of \u2018bloodbath\u2019 for auto industry and country if he loses the election, CNN, Sun, 17 Mar 2024 04:12:00 GMT\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

            "text": "A coalition of 16 Republican states, led by Texas and Louisiana, filed a lawsuit against the Biden administration, challenging its recent climate action pausing proposed energy projects.\n\nThe multistate coalition filed its complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana, listing President Biden, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm and the Department of Energy (DOE) among the defendants in the case. According to the complaint, the DOE\u2019s move earlier this year pausing major liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminal projects violated long-standing federal energy laws.\n\n\u201cBiden\u2019s unilateral decree disregards statutory mandates, flouts the legal process, upends the oil and gas industry, disrupts the Texas economy, and subverts our constitutional structure,\u201d said Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton.\n\n\u201cThe ban will drive billions of dollars in investment away from Texas, hinder our ability to maximize revenue for public schools, force Texas producers to flare excess natural gas instead of taking it to market, and annihilate critical jobs,\u201d he continued. \u201cI will not stand by while Biden attacks Texas.\u201d\n\nGOP LEADERS CONFRONT BIDEN\u2019S NEW CLIMATE CZAR ON KEY SECURITY RISKS LURKING IN GREEN AGENDA\n\nAccording to Paxton, the LNG export moratorium is unconstitutional, ignores the 1938 Natural Gas Act\u2019s \u201cpresumption in favor of exports\u201d and discards decades of DOE energy policy.\n\nIn arguing the alleged unconstitutionality of the policy, the states\u2019 complaint notes Article I of the Constitution vests Congress with \u201c[a]ll legislative Powers,\u201d including the power \u201c[t]o regulate Commerce with foreign Nations.\u201d Therefore, since blocking LNG exports can be considered a regulation of commerce, the DOE violated the Constitution, according to the lawsuit.\n\nTIKTOK ACTIVIST SAYS HE ADVISED WHITE HOUSE ON BIDEN\u2019S NEW NATURAL GAS MORATORIUM\n\n\u201cThe LNG Export Ban implicates an issue of profound national importance. LNG exports account for billions of dollars to the economy and thousands of jobs,\u201d the complaint states. \u201cThey also raise serious questions of national security. And this is an issue that has been the subject of proposed legislation and public attention in and outside of Congress.\u201d\n\nThe complaint accuses DOE of violating the Administrative Procedure Act which governs the procedures of administrative law. The states highlight that DOE failed to host any public comment period before finalizing its LNG policy without \u201cgood cause to forego the notice and comment requirement.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, the states argue the DOE failed to properly consider the Natural Gas Act and its provision that states the agency issue an export license before hearing from the public.\n\nDOZENS OF FORMER TOP FEDERAL OFFICIALS CALL ON CONGRESS TO STRIKE DOWN BIDEN\u2019S NATURAL GAS CRACKDOWN\n\n\u201cThe Biden administration\u2019s illegal attacks on American energy jeopardizes the livelihoods of thousands of hard-working Louisiana men and women, millions of dollars in tax revenue, and billions of dollars in infrastructure,\u201d said Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill.\n\n\u201cLNG continues to have an enormous positive economic impact for our state \u2014 especially on our hard-hit coastal communities, which continue to recover from a recent series of devastating hurricanes. Jobs like these grow the economy, reduce crime, and help address the out-migration problem,\u201d she continued. \u201cThe people of Louisiana are proud to power this nation. I\u2019m ready to fight for them.\u201d\n\nIn a surprise move in January, Biden ordered the DOE to pause pending permits for LNG export facilities while federal officials conduct a rigorous environmental review assessing the projects\u2019 carbon emissions, which could take more than a year to complete. The action was lauded by climate activists who have loudly called for such a move, which they said would help combat global warming.\n\nHowever, the move was blasted by industry groups, former federal officials and bipartisan lawmakers, who noted energy exports are vital for aiding allies in Europe and Asia. In the aftermath of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine two years ago, U.S. LNG largely filled the void left by Russian natural gas as U.S. allies sought to wean off Russian exports and punish the nation\u2019s economy, a plan Biden endorsed at the time.",

            "text": "Biden Campaign Distances Itself From Mysterious Big Dem Donor \u2018Chairman G\u2019\n\nAuthored by Soobin Kim and Bradley Hope via whalehunting.projectbrazen.com,\n\nLast fall, we reported on a man named Gaurav Srivastava who pretended to be a CIA operative to allegedly fleece the sanctioned Dutch oil trader Niels Troost. The ruse was simple, according to extensive recorded conversations: hand over half your company to me, a secret spy, and I\u2019ll protect you from the US government because \u2026 I\u2019m a secret spy.\n\nIn the following months since our original article, it emerged that Srivastava \u2013 or \u201cChairman G,\u201d as he likes to be called \u2013 is a big time political donor in the United States.\n\nWhale Hunting can exclusively reveal that FBI agents in Los Angeles have been interviewing Srivastava\u2019s current and former associates about his campaign donations, claims of being a federal officer and other financial affairs.\n\nWe also confirmed from a staff member for the Washington State Democratic Party that the Biden campaign is in the process of quietly refunding thousands of dollars of his political donations.\n\nThe FBI inquiries \u2014 ongoing for last several months \u2014 may lead nowhere, but the Biden campaign\u2019s decision to start refunding donations suggests there are deeper issues afoot for Srivastava.\n\n\u201cAll allegations raised in this story are false,\u201d a spokesman for Srivastava told us (full statement and more details on the news after the jump).\n\nSource: Sponsored content on LA Weekly\n\nThe culmination of Srivastava\u2019s rise to public life came alongside a more than $1 million donation in 2022 to the Atlantic Council, a DC-based think tank. The money underwrote a conference in Bali, where he was a \u201cco-host\u201d and rubbed shoulders with business magnates, political honchos and John Legend.\n\nBut that relationship isn\u2019t going smoothly. The Atlantic Council terminated its relationship with Srivastava, Politico reported last month, and returned additional funds donated by Srivastava in 2023.\n\n\u201cWe made the decision to terminate our relationship with Mr. Srivastava in May 2023 upon learning new information because of our donor review process. For example, we learned that The Gaurav & Sharon Srivastava Family Foundation was not an established 501C3 in April of 2023, despite Mr. Srivastava\u2019s representation to the Council that this was a registered foundation,\u201d the spokesperson told Politico.\n\nSrivastava\u2019s lawyer told Politico the Atlantic Council made the decision after they \u201cdisagreed\u201d about how a gift would be implemented. (Small note: Recipients of gifts usually try very hard to implement the handover of gifts.)\n\nAlongside his campaign to solve global food security he also became a big spender on political campaigns. Among Srivastava\u2019s key advisors for how to best disperse funds for political purposes were Greg Schultz (Biden\u2019s 2020 campaign manager) and Ret. General Wesley Clark. They didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe Federal Election Commission\u2019s database of individual contributions shows that Srivastava contributed at least $1 million to political campaigns and committees in the United States. As an Indian national he is eligible to donate to political campaigns as a Green Card holder. Lo and behold, the donations led to a photo op with Biden which you can find here.\n\nSince 2022, Srivastava has made sizeable donations \u2013 including over $500,000 to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and $500,000 to Senate Majority PAC.\n\nOne mystery we are continuing to investigate: Whale Hunting discovered publicly available evidence suggesting Srivastava contributed over $116,000 using the personal details of an individual with the same name who resides in the same city. The funds were donated under the previous employer, occupation and mailing address of the namesake, who denies making the donations.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how those donations were made. Impersonating another individual to make a political contribution is strictly prohibited by law.\n\nThe single biggest recipient for the donations made with the namesake\u2019s personal details was the Biden Victory Fund, a joint fundraising committee for Joe Biden\u2019s 2024 re-election, which received $50,000. About a dozen state Democratic parties across the U.S. also received funds through the Biden Victory Fund.\n\n\u201cThe Biden campaign is aware of the issue and the donation is in the process of being refunded,\u201d a staff member with Washington State Democratic Party, which received these funds, told Whale Hunting in an email.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear the exact allegations the FBI is investigating, but among the questions they\u2019ve presented current and former associates of Srivastava have been queries about his political spending, source of funds, involvement in international money transfers and other topics related to the allegations already aired publicly about Srivastava in a litany of lawsuits.\n\nSrivastava\u2019s spokesman\u2019s full comment here:\n\nAll allegations raised in this story are false. The source for this story and others, including 87 paid stories on obscure websites, is tied to a Russian asset facilitating the unfettered trade of Russian oil as made clear by the U.K. sanctions. There\u2019s a direct through-line between Russia, a barrel of oil and the high price of gas at the pump squeezing the American consumer. The slanderous suggestion of a fabricated relationship between Mr. Srivastava and a U.S. intelligence agency was orchestrated by the same Russian asset relied on as a source for your stories and designed by that Russian asset to put a target on his back, threatening the safety of him, his friends and family.\n\nSo if your year is off to a bad start, think about what Srivastava is now dealing with: being on the Feds\u2019 radar, juggling a glut of lawsuits brought on by all the people he\u2019s allegedly stiffed \u2013 from his former interior designer to former landlord to former business partners \u2013 and witnessing the collapse of his carefully crafted reputation.\n\nIn the meantime, Whale Hunting will be chasing this story to fill its gaping plot holes, one among them being where on earth Chairman G got the funds to make the donations in the first place. If you have any insight, please get in touch!",

            "text": "Mike Benz: I just have to break this down in a video to make it perfectly plain and clear to people what\u2019s happening with Hunter Biden and the CIA. Why was I saying a year and a half ago that the reason Hunter Biden is untouchable by the Justice Department is because he was part of a CIA operation. Multiple ones, actually.\n\nYou have to understand what\u2019s going on here. Let me just give you a dozen data points on Hunter Biden CIA. The first thing is, Hunter was on the Chairman\u2019s Advisory Board of the National Democratic Institute, the NDI. The NDI is the DNC wing of the National Endowment for Democracy, which is the top CIA cutout used in our tens of thousands of NGO swarms. NED ranks number one. It was created to be the NGO affiliate of the CIA. It was created to do overtly what the CIA was doing covertly and getting in trouble for doing in the 20th century, created under the Reagan administration in 1983. There\u2019s something called the NDI for Democrats and the for Republicans, the CIA wing of the Republican Party. They both split spoils, basically on US foreign policy jobs that the CIA orchestrates.\n\nYou don\u2019t get to be part of the chairman\u2019s advisory committee of the NDI unless you are CIA-linked or CIA-vetted. It is a CIA. \u2013 NGOs, government-organized, non-governmental organizations. This is a CIA-organize a CIA-organized, non-CIA organization. It\u2019s the CIA. He\u2019s on the chairman\u2019s advisory board of that. By the way, when he was at Burisma, who was the other person on the Barisma board from the US there was Cofer Black, who had spent 30 years in the CIA. Cofer Black was Mitt Romney\u2019s Sherpa to the intelligence community during his presidential run in 2012. You know what? Mitt Romney is on the board of the IRI, who I just mentioned, the International Republican Institute, the CIA cut out counterpart to the NDI. Barisma was a CIA operation. Let me say this again. Burisma was a CIA operation. So was Naftagas. That\u2019s the public and then, respectively, the private and public natural gas companies there. There were a couple of other private ones in addition to Burisma. But the CIA was trying to break down Gazprom and swing the gas market from Russia to NATO. They\u2019ve been trying to do this for 16 friggin\u2019 years.\n\nIt\u2019s been an in-process CIA, State Department, Pentagon project for 16 frigging years. They were trying to capacity build Burisma and shift its board to make it US-controlled. They\u2019re doing the same thing simultaneously with Naftogaz, the feeder that Burisma feeds into. You can even read about the power struggle between George Soros and Vladimir Putin for control over Naftogaz, the state-owned titan that has been the privatization prize of the IMF. That is, that was part of the reason that we overthrew the Ukrainian government in 2014, is to privatize those assets because we knew that we were going to be cutting Russia off. So Western stakeholders wanted to profit from this trillion-dollar windfall if Russia could be kicked out the European energy market.\n\nThis is common activity for the Central Intelligence Agency, which was created by corporate lawyers in 1947 as its first class. The corporate espionage side of the CIA operation here has geopolitical dimensions. If you kill Russia\u2019s energy exports, you kill their military, which means you kill their ability to run air defense systems to Syria. You kill their ability to run small arms to sub-Saharan Africa to oppose US control over lithium and cobalt and copper and aluminum and gold and oil and gas there, too.\n\nThis was a long-range CIA project where Hunter Biden happened to be ass deep in exactly the number one geopolitical target of what the CIA was doing under the Obama administration, which is trying to kill Russia\u2019s energy exports. Meanwhile, you had this endogenous Ukrainian gas company that Hunter\u2019s on the board of. By the way, who\u2019s Hunter\u2019s dad at the time? It\u2019s Joe Biden, the vice President in charge of the Ukraine portfolio. But Joe Biden spent 30 10 years on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, 10 years rotating between chairman and ranking member. That is the coordinating wing of the Senate with the State Department and the CIA. It\u2019s specifically Central and Eastern Europe. Joe Biden was hugely involved in the Yugoslavia operation in the late 1990s, and breaking that up, which again was a CIA job, okay? That\u2019s why you have to understand the structure of the blob. Whenever you see the State Department, the CIA CIA is there and the Pentagon are there, and you just don\u2019t see it yet. Whenever you see the CIA, the State Department and the Pentagon there, you just don\u2019t see it yet. Even British intelligence is all over this LNG story.\n\nYou don\u2019t get British intelligence without US intelligence. The fact is, the CIA will lean on the Justice Department. I just did six hours of subscriber streams about the relationship between CIA and DOJ, and that the CIA will lean on DOJ to kill investigations into criminal activity involving assets of the CIA so that they can continue to do work that\u2019s in the US national interest, even if it\u2019s a criminal enterprise.\n\nBecause the CIA has a license to do that. They have the license to crime under NSC 10-2. They\u2019re licensed to do criminal activity as long as it\u2019s plausibly deniable. Hunter Biden was a part of a plausibly deniable CIA operation to swing the gas market towards That\u2019s why it\u2019s untouchable.",

As Trump in February handily won primary contests in Nevada and New Hampshire, the prospects of any Republican challenger overtaking him in the presidential race dimmed significantly.\n\n''Americans know that they were better off with President Trump four years ago than with Crooked Joe Biden and his disastrous policies. We need a return to America First policies that successfully kept our country safe and supercharged the economy for all Americans,\" Trump's campaign Communications Director Steven Cheung said in a statement.\n\nUnimpressed, Biden campaign Communications Director Michael Tyler said in a statement, ''If Donald Trump put up these kinds of numbers on The Apprentice, he'd fire himself,.\"\n\n''But here's why he ain't got it: his extreme, toxic agenda of banning abortion, slashing Social Security, and promoting political violence is repelling donors and doing exactly (asterisk)nothing(asterisk) to earn support from the voters who will decide this election.''\n\nBiden's campaign, meanwhile, said his political operation raised $53 million last month and ended February with $155 million on hand.

            "text": "Bernie Moreno, Republican candidate for Senate, speaks in Salem, Ohio, on Friday, March 15, 2024. Photo: Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images\n\nFor the second election cycle in a row, Donald Trump has intervened in a highly competitive multi-candidate Ohio Republican Senate primary and pulled off a win that reinforces his dominant position in the GOP. Trump\u2019s endorsee, auto-dealer magnate Bernie Moreno, beat State Senator (and Cleveland Guardians co-owner) Matt Dolan and Secretary of State Frank LaRose decisively on March 19. With over 96 percent percent of the expected vote in, Moreno is winning just over half the total votes and leading by Dolan by 18 percent. It\u2019s a broad-based victory, since Moreno is ahead in all of Ohio\u2019s 88 counties. (Trump won his own primary over withdrawn rival Nikki Haley by a 79 percent to 14 percent margin).\n\nMoreno is definitely over-performing expectations. He led Dolan, who was backed by Governor Mike DeWine and former senator Rob Portman, and who outspent him by a significant margin, by a spare two points in the final RealClearPolitics polling averages on the race. Trump will undoubtedly take credit for the Moreno surge, having conducted an Ohio rally with his candidate over the last weekend. But Democrats may have had something to do with the outcome; a super-PAC associated with the Democratic Party sank upward of $3 million on ads boosting Moreno among Republican voters by attacking him as \u201ctoo conservative for Ohio.\u201d It\u2019s also possible that some Democrats slipped over to the GOP primary (the Buckeye State has open primaries) to help Moreno given incumbent Senator Sherrod Brown\u2019s unopposed nomination quest.\n\nMoreno may have drawn this unfriendly assistance because he\u2019s recently gone loud and proud extremist MAGA, as opposed to Dolan, who endorsed Trump\u2019s presidential candidacy but has mostly campaigned as a standard-brand Republican conservative with some moderate leanings. Another factor could be weird recent reports linking a Moreno email account to a hookup site where someone purporting to be him solicited gay sex back in the day. That mostly matters because Moreno has trended harshly anti-LGBTQ in his current Senate race.\n\nBut at this point the Moreno primary win makes Trump two-for-two in recent Ohio Senate primaries. His late endorsement of J.D. Vance in 2022 clearly played a role in the Hillbilly Elegy author surviving a crowded GOP contest (in which Dolan was a candidate while Moreno withdrew after failing to get Trump\u2019s support). Vance went on to defeat Democratic candidate Tim Ryan by a comfortable margin.\n\nMoreno begins his general-election campaign with a lot of doubts about his viability against the perennially popular Brown, but also some advantages thanks to the high likelihood that Trump will again win the state handily (he carried Ohio by an identical 8.1 percent margin in both 2016 and 2020).\n\nIf Trump\u2019s Senate candidate wins in November, it would go a long way toward flipping the upper chamber toward the GOP and would also give Ohio a matched set of MAGA senators in Vance and Moreno. That would represent a significant devolution of the state that was the ultimate dead-even battleground as recently as 2004. Right now Sherrod Brown stands alone as a potential salvager of statewide Democratic hopes in Ohio.",

He is stopping short of drawing up articles of impeachment against the president, but eying criminal referrals of Biden family wrongdoing to the Justice Department for possible prosecution.\n\nWith the panel\u2019s star witness, Hunter Biden, not expected to appear for Wednesday\u2019s public hearing after having testified privately last month, Comer telegraphed what was coming next.\u201dIf he does not show up, then it\u2019s not going to end well for the Bidens,\u201d Comer said over the weekend on Fox News.

Parnas has since played a key role in dispelling the House GOP\u2019s main claim of bribery against the Bidens as simply not true.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWho better than Lev Parnas himself \u2014 Rudy Giuliani\u2019s right-hand man on the original mission to smear Joe Biden \u2014 to tell the story of how this campaign of lies and slander works?\u201d said Rep.

It\u2019s unclear who would exactly be charged, and over what offenses, and Comer has also discussed drafting ethics-related legislation to tighten influence peddling or foreign lobbying among officials.\n\nRead more | Hunter Biden indicted on nine tax charges, adding to gun charges in special counsel probe\n\nA House committee spokesperson said that the impeachment inquiry is ongoing without a predetermined outcome.

But the Biden-Harris campaign plans to highlight key moments from four years ago in an effort to flip the question back onto Trump, seeing a golden opportunity to exploit his handling of the pandemic.\n\nThe Biden campaign made a statement Friday morning highlighting Trump\u2019s pledge four years ago to the day to \u201cterminate\u201d the Affordable Care Act, roughly 10 days after the World Health Organization formally declared Covid a global pandemic.\n\n\u201cFour years ago today, Trump was trying to throw millions of Americans off their insurance while Americans were dying by the thousands of Covid-19, even more Americans were infected, and hospitals were reaching a breaking point,\u201d Biden-Harris senior spokesperson Sarafina Chitika said in a statement.\n\nOn Thursday, the campaign released a digital ad that paired images from the early days of the pandemic with audio of Trump suggesting disinfectant as a treatment, downplaying concerns over the number of Covid-related deaths at the time, and dismissing questions from reporters about his handling of the crisis.\n\nAnd Biden is test-driving the strategy on the stump while speaking at fundraisers in Texas.\n\n\u201cJust a few days ago, he asked the famous question, \u2018Are you better off today than you were yesterday?\u2019 Well, Donald, I\u2019m glad you asked that question,\u201d Biden said during a campaign reception in Houston on Thursday. (The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nBiden pointed to Trump\u2019s handling of the pandemic and a debunked claim that Trump suggested the injection of bleach as a treatment option.\n\n\u201cHe must\u2019ve done it,\u201d Biden joked.\n\nIt comes amid a broader effort by Biden and his campaign to co-opt language made popular by Trump and the Republicans.\n\nIn a bid to highlight that Biden held more campaign events this month than Trump, Biden\u2019s campaign accused the former president of \u201chiding in his basement\u201d \u2014 a line Trump and his allies frequently deployed about Biden in 2020.\n\nThe campaign has also turned \u201cBrandon\u201d \u2014 a code word used by Republicans to insult Biden \u2014 into a kind of internet alter-ego and a core component of his social media branding, launching a \u201cDark Brandon\u201d account on X and releasing several \u201cDark Brandon\u201d-branded memes.\n\nA senior Biden-Harris campaign official told NBC News the campaign will continue to highlight \u201ckey moments from four years ago throughout the month of April.\u201d\n\nThose moments will include headlines reminding voters of rising crime and toilet paper shortages toward the end of Trump\u2019s term and footage reminding voters of the \u201cchaos\u201d of the pandemic in 2020.\n\n\u201cAmericans remember March Madness, proms, weddings, and celebrations being canceled, waiting in line for toilet paper and essentials, businesses shutting down, and losing loved ones \u2014 all because Trump failed to prepare for and then couldn\u2019t lead when we needed him the most,\u201d Biden campaign spokesperson Ammar Moussa said. \u201cThe only thing to happen four years ago to make Americans\u2019 lives better was Donald Trump losing to Joe Biden.\u201d\n\nThis article was originally published on NBCNews.com",

            "text": "Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n\n(WASHINGTON) \u2014 In his State of the Union address this month, President Joe Biden boasted that the nation reported a historically low murder rate in 2023 and violent crime had plummeted to one of the lowest levels in 50 years.\n\nFor some Americans, however, the perception of crime is clashing with the statistics.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe it, plain and simple. I don\u2019t believe it because we\u2019re experiencing different results,\u201d Auriol Sonia Morris \u2014 a South Carolina education, finance and legal consultant who describes herself as a Black conservative Republican and a supporter of former President Donald Trump \u2014 told ABC News.\n\nMorris, a former Democrat who voted for Bill Clinton in the 1992 presidential election, said she has not noticed a significant decline in crime in her state.\n\nAccording to a Forbes magazine study released this month on the most dangerous states in America, South Carolina ranks eighth with a crime rate of 4.91 violent crimes per every 1,000 residents. Still, an annual report published in November by the South Carolina State Law Enforcement Division found overall violent crime dropped 2.6% from 2021 to 2022, including a 12% decrease in homicides.\n\n\u2018False sense of security\u2019\n\n\u201cYou can always find a statistic for your side. But the average person knows that that is not the case. It\u2019s almost like you\u2019re lulling the people into a false sense of security when the experience is far different,\u201d said Morris, adding that she was compelled to run for Congress as a conservative Republican in 2022 by issues underlying crime in her 6th Congressional district, citing high poverty, a poor education system and lack of employment opportunities.\n\nFor many in America who are victims, crime is a reality more than a perception.\n\nPierre Augustine, a Brooklyn, New York, resident, told ABC News that his perception of crime is not based on the statistics showing crime in the New York City transit system fell 2.6% in 2023 compared to 2022. In February 2023, the 66-year-old Augustine was waiting for a subway train in Brooklyn\u2019s Crown Heights neighborhood when he was randomly pushed onto the tracks allegedly by a homeless stranger police described as a 44-year-old recidivist criminal. Augustine said this week that he still suffers from injuries he sustained in the attack and hasn\u2019t taken a subway since.\n\n\u201cI can tell you, crime is going up and up,\u201d Augustine said. \u201cEvery day you listen to the news, there is a crime in the subway stations.\u201d\n\nAnd while subway crime was down from 2024 to 2023, it actually rose by 46% in January 2024 compared to January 2023, illustrating that overall crime statistics don\u2019t always tell the whole story.\n\nThe most recent crime numbers lend merit to Augustine\u2019s statement. According to the NYPD, crime in the transit system is up roughly 7% in 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 and includes a series of recent violent attacks and shootings that prompted New York Gov. Kathy Hochul to deploy the National Guard to the subway system this month.\n\nFor Black Americans nationwide, particularly young men, becoming the victim of violent crime remains disproportionately high.\n\nWhile Blacks account for 14% of the U.S. population, they comprise 60% of those killed by firearm homicides annually, according to an analysis published in February by the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence. The study, based on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 2017 to 2021, showed Black males 18- to 24-years-old are 23 times more likely to die by firearm homicide than their white male peers.\n\nHate crimes are also rising across the country, according to a report from the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino. The report titled \u201cFaith Under Fire\u201d and published in January, found that hate crimes across the United States increased 11% in 2023 from 2022, with antisemitic and anti-Muslim hate crimes soaring in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nIn New York City, antisemitic hate crimes jumped 12.6% and anti-Muslim hate crimes rose 22%. In Los Angeles, antisemitic hate crimes rose 48% in 2023 and anti-Muslim hate crimes climbed 40%, according to the report. Those numbers have continued to rise in the first month of 2024 as the NYPD\u2019s Hate Crime Task Force has seen a 12% increase in bias crimes, according to police department statistics.\n\nMore than three-quarters of Americans say there is more crime in the U.S. than a year ago and more than half of Americans say the same about crime in their local area, according to a Gallup poll released in November.\n\nHoward Lavine, a professor of political psychology at the University of Minnesota, said the perception of crime is skewed by a focus on year-over-year statistics and not by a historical perspective.\n\n\u201cThis is a long-term phenomenon. Crime has decreased since the middle of Bill Clinton\u2019s first term precipitously,\u201d Lavine told ABC News. \u201cIt isn\u2019t a simple story of linear decline from whenever it started to right now. It was until the pandemic and then it spiked, and now it\u2019s on the way back down to that baseline where you would predict if there were no pandemic. But it is one of the very long-term misperceptions that Americans have.\u201d\n\nLavine said many Americans are what he referred to as \u201cpattern association constructors.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how the human mind works. We can be easily led to see things that aren\u2019t there when people lead us to co-occurrences that are in fact not only there, but the real co-occurrences are exactly the opposite,\u201d Lavine said.\n\nHe said that in most presidential elections where there\u2019s a Democratic incumbent, the issue of crime is going to be salient \u201cwhether it\u2019s decreasing as it has been in the last 30 years or it\u2019s going to be morphed into some other issue like migration.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are issues that the public trusts the Republicans on more than we trust the Democrats. Crime is a prime example,\u201d Lavine said.\n\n13% decline in violent crime in 2023\n\nThe FBI quarterly uniform crime report published on Tuesday indicates a widespread decrease in violent crime during 2023 compared to the previous year, as well as a 13% decline in homicides relative to 2022.\n\nBiden and Attorney General Merrick Garland highlighted the FBI\u2019s report in separate statements, crediting the Department of Justice\u2019s violent crime reduction strategy launched in 2021 and the White House\u2019s American Rescue Plan, which committed $15 billion to preventing crime and reducing violence.\n\n\u201cWe know that hard-fought progress can easily slip away, and we must remain focused and vigilant,\u201d Garland said in a statement.\n\nBiden touted the FBI stats as \u201cgood news\u201d for Americans.\n\n\u201cAcross America, families want the same thing: Freedom to feel safe in their community. To know their kids are secure,\u201d Biden said. \u201cMy administration is making it a reality.\u201d\n\n\u2018Optics outweigh the analytics\u2019\n\nDespite the falling crime numbers, Trump and his supporters are making violent crime a major issue in the 2024 presidential election, conflating it with the migrant crisis at the southern border. They have seized on the slaying of 22-year-old nursing student Laken Hope Riley, who was attacked and killed while jogging in a park at the University of Georgia on Feb. 22 allegedly by a migrant from Venezuela authorities said illegally entered the country in 2022.\n\n\u201cShe was brutally murdered by one of the millions of illegal border crossers President Biden chose to release into our homeland,\u201d Alabama Sen. Katie Britt said in the Republican rebuttal to Biden\u2019s State of the Union address. \u201cAs a mom, I can\u2019t quit thinking about this. I mean, this could have been my daughter.\u201d\n\nBut a Stanford University study published in July titled \u201cThe mythical tie between immigration and crime,\u201d found immigrants are 30% less likely to be incarcerated than are U.S.-born white individuals. When expanded to include Black Americans \u2014 whose incarceration rate is estimated to be five times higher than whites \u2014 the likelihood of an immigrant being incarcerated is 60% lower than of people born in the United States, according to the study.\n\nDespite the statistics showing otherwise, Trump has described the surge of migrants crossing the southern border as \u201cpoisoning the blood of our country.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe optics outweigh the analytics right now,\u201d Robert Boyce, the retired chief of detectives for the New York Police Department, said of the clashing perspectives on crime.\n\nHe said fears that crime is out of control are being fueled by the enormous news media attention paid to recent high-profile incidents: Among them, a Feb. 20 mass shooting at the Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl victory parade that left one person dead and 22 injured; a March 7 mass shooting at a Philadelphia SEPTA bus stop that left eight teenagers wounded, in including one in critical condition; and three unrelated Spring Break shootings in an hour on March 17 in Jacksonville Beach, Florida, in which one person was killed and three others were wounded.\n\n\u201cWe see these things we think, \u2018Oh, this is just terrible\u2019 and it is, but it kind of belies the issue that crime is down in the last couple of years,\u201d Boyce said.\n\nQuest to get back to 2019 numbers\n\nThe Major Cities Police Association\u2019s Violent Crime Survey found double-digit declines in homicide across nearly 70 of America\u2019s largest cities in 2023 compared 2022.\n\nBut while cities with traditionally high crime levels like New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago and Philadelphia saw homicides decline by 12% to 21%, other cities saw sharp increases in slayings in 2023 compared to 2022. Homicides went up 24% in Memphis, 27% in Washington, D.C., 15% in Dallas and 14% in Kansas City.\n\nAccording to NYPD crime statistics, violent crime in New York City is continuing to fall in 2024. Through March 17, the data show homicides are down 19% from the same period in 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, violent crime in the New York City housing developments fell 3.2% in 2023 from the previous year, according to the NYPD data.\n\nBoyce said while overall crime has fallen substantially in the past two years, it is still higher than it was in 2019 before homicides soared 30% in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic that shut down criminal courts and prompted a reduction in prison and jail populations throughout the country to curb the virus. It was also a time when the George Floyd police custody killing in Minnesota triggered protests and demands to defund police agencies.\n\n\u201cWe were up 30,000 crimes [in New York City] in 2023 versus 2019. That\u2019s substantial,\u201d said Boyce.\n\nAccording to historical data from the Major Cities Chiefs Association, homicides and aggravated assaults nationwide are up 17% and 14% respectively from 2019.\n\n\u201cThe drop in crime [between 2022 and 2023] is welcomed by everybody. It should be and the police departments are doing their job across the country,\u201d Boyce said. \u201cBut the analytics are from last year, not from 2019, where they should be.\u201d\n\nBoyce added, \u201cWe can do so much better and I think we can. But it doesn\u2019t serve anybody with scare tactics that crime is really up. It\u2019s not what it was, but it\u2019s better than it has been.\u201d\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024, ABC Audio.

Ultra-processed foods are defined as foods that are heavily processed and contain additives like sugar, fat, and salt. The researchers suggest that individuals should limit their consumption of ultra-processed foods and opt for more whole, unprocessed foods to reduce their risk of developing type 2 diabetes.\n\nThis study sheds light on the importance of a healthy diet in preventing chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes. By making simple changes to their diet and opting for more whole, unprocessed foods, individuals can reduce their risk of developing this serious condition.

Why, then, did Hunter yell at CEFC Executive Director Zang in front of his entourage as I sat right next to him in New York City on Sunday May 7th, 2017? Hunter was adamant that he was owed the rest of the $20 Million CEFC had committed to paying for the work he had claimed he had done in prior years.\"In the second instance, Bobulinski argued that Hunter Biden lied when he claimed that Joe Biden never interacted with Hunter\u2019s associates:\"On Page 48 of his transcript, Hunter is asked, 'He\u2019s never interacted with any of your business associates. Is that correct?' The 'He\u2019s' is a reference to Joe Biden. Hunter responds, 'Yes'. Hunter arranged the meeting between his father and me at the Beverly Hilton in Los Angeles on May 2, 2017. The sole reason Hunter wanted me to meet his father was because I was the CEO of Sinohawk, the Bidens\u2019 partnership with CEFC. I was a business associate. In his transcript, Hunter confirms that that meeting with Joe took place and incriminates his Uncle Jim for perjury by confirming it.\"In the third example, Bobulinski said Hunter \u201clied\u201d about leveraging Joe Biden to receive a $5 million payment from CEFC:\"Hunter lied to the Committee about important details concerning his money demands and threats to CEFC on July 30 and July 31, 2017. He leveraged his father\u2019s presence next to him in that infamous text in order to strong-arm CEFC into paying Hunter immediately and in the process defrauded the partners of Sinohawk Holdings LLC and Oneida Holdings LLC. The threat worked, as a few days later the Chinese wired $5 million dollars into a company of which Hunter owned 50%. It\u2019s important to remember that CEFC considered this money an interest-free loan to the 'Biden family,' and planned to send more. I have the email from CEFC to prove it.\"Bobulinski also said Joe Biden was \u201cmore than a participant in and beneficiary of his family\u2019s business\u201d but \u201cwas an active, aware enabler who met with business associates such as myself to further the business, despite being buffered by a complex scheme to maintain plausible deniability.\u201d\u201cIf there is no evidence of corruption \u2013 if Joe\u2019s conduct and the conduct of his family were fully legal and proper \u2013 then why are they so dishonest about it?\u201d Bobulinski asked. \u201cNot just slight misrepresentations of fact but deep untruths about the entire corrupt enterprise.\u201dSouth Carolina Republican Rep. Nancy Mace fired off an intense round of \"yes or no\" questions aimed at Joe Biden's involvement in his son's business dealings.Mace directed her questions to Bobulinski and another ex-Hunter Biden business associate, Jason Galanis, asking them to verify various interactions with Biden, Hunter and the business associates concerning various deals and transactions.Those interactions included Joe Biden taking calls from Hunter where he updated his dad on certain business deals, confirming a reserved board seat for Joe Biden at a company, that Joe Biden lied when he denied meeting with Hunter's business partners, and that the family received money from Chinese business interests.Bobulinski and Galanis answered \"yes\" to each of Mace's questions.\"Joe Biden has repeatedly claimed that he was not involved in Hunter Biden's, Jim Biden's, or any other Biden family business deals. Today our witnesses have proved otherwise,\" Mace said at the conclusion of her questioning.Bobulinski also directly confronted two Democrat members of the Oversight Committee, accusing them of lying in the media about the impeachment inquiry. \"Representatives Dan Goldman and Jamie Raskin, both lawyers, and Mr. Goldman a former prosecutor with the Southern District of New York, will continue to lie today in this hearing and then go straight to the media to tell more lies,\" he said in his opening statement.\n\nYour Choice\n\nFree Press International\n\n[\n\nPublish This Content\n\n]",

But he comes back for it.\u201d\n\nThe message is played over a heart monitor image that eventually flattens out.\n\nAs president, Trump is one vote away from repealing the law and has said he would like to try again.\n\n\u201cIf he succeeds\u202645 million Americans could lose their health insurance,\u201d the ad said. \u201cAnd you just might be one of them.\u201d\n\nThe campaign says the ads will air across battleground states in English and Spanish on digital platforms including Meta, YouTube and connected TV.\n\nIn addition to the ad, the campaign will hold a digital rally this weekend featuring former President Barack Obama and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). The nationwide appeal is aimed at \u201cmobilizing supporters and volunteers to protect the ACA from President Trump\u2019s attacks,\u201d the campaign said.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee is also running digital ads in battleground states denouncing President Trump\u2019s efforts to repeal the ACA.\n\nThe ads will be displayed on local newspaper websites in Pennsylvania, Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina, Georgia, Michigan and Wisconsin, which will be carried over to digital homepages.\n\nThe Biden campaign and its Democratic allies are eager to take on President Trump over Obamacare after the Republican nominee resurfaces with a view to repealing the law.\n\nMore than 40 million people have health insurance through Obamacare, and this law is more popular than ever. Biden campaign officials believe maintaining the system is a key political challenge as press requests reach a record high of 21.3 million in 2024.\n\nBiden and Democrats have long felt that health care is a win-win issue for them, and the president has turned to the pocketbook of cutting payroll costs amid broader concerns about the economy.\n\n\u201cWe cannot take this progress for granted. Extreme MAGA Republicans have voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act more than 50 times. Just this week, President Trump\u2019s allies in the House of Representatives has proposed a budget that guts this lifesaving bill,\u201d Biden said in a statement Friday, referring to the Republican Study Committee\u2019s budget proposal.\n\n\u201cIt is no exaggeration to say that millions of people will have affordable health care in November. I will repel the attacks of MAGA Republicans and make health care in America a right, not a privilege. We are more determined than ever to do so,\u201d Biden said.\n\nThe Biden campaign is also trying to capitalize on President Trump\u2019s \u201cam I better\u201d argument.\n\nOn Friday, Biden\u2019s team highlighted a clip from a press conference held at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic exactly four years ago. At the time, President Trump said he wanted to \u201cend\u201d Obamacare and reiterated his support for a lawsuit seeking to repeal the law. .\n\n\u201cTaking health care coverage away from millions of Americans is always a bad idea, but President Trump\u2019s attempt in March 2020, when thousands of Americans were dying, could not have come at a worse time.\u201d said the camp. \u201cDonald Trump and his campaign continue to ask the country if we are better off today than we were four years ago.

President Biden made it happen.\"\n\nMcCall claimed Biden is promoting domestic manufacturing and \"widespread prosperity\" in the long term by \"strategically combining these historic investments with a worker-centered trade policy that is rebuilding supply chains and supporting critical industries.\" He also credited the Democratic incumbent and his administration for advancing workers\u2019 interests.\n\n\"President Biden\u2019s leadership revitalized the Department of Labor and National Labor Relations Board so that they are once again fulfilling their mission to empower working people. And he consistently held firm on protecting Americans\u2019 retirement security, fending off attacks on Social Security and Medicare,\" McCall said. \"Among the many accomplishments of Biden\u2019s American Rescue Plan was shoring up the troubled multi-employer pension plans that put more than a million workers\u2019 retirements in jeopardy through no fault of their own \u2014 including 120,000 USW members and retirees.

            "text": "Author: Natasha Lindstaedt\n\n(MENAFN- The Conversation) With Donald Trump leading in many of the polls for the upcoming US presidential election, his comments about global security and foreign policy have to be taken seriously.\n\nIn February, Trump flippantly remarked that he would encourage Russia to do whatever it wanted to Nato states that failed to pay their bills . In a follow-up interview on GB News this week he warned allies\u201cnot to take advantage\u201d of the US.\n\nNowhere is this causing more concern than for the countries in the Baltic states \u2013 Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.\n\nNot only does Trump, sometimes, say he wants to halt all US military aid to Ukraine, but Trump wants to undercut article 5 of Nato's treaty \u2013 the principle of collective defence \u2013 something that has become increasingly important in the wake of Russia's aggression. British military sources are worried that Trump's remarks will strengthen Putin's resolve over Ukraine, and could result in him advancing on even more territory.\n\nEven before Trump emerged on the US political scene, the Baltic countries have been especially concerned about Russia's growing ambitions. They have, after all, been invaded and occupied by Russia before , in 1940, and then forced to become part of the Soviet Union . There's plenty of people who can still remember life in the Soviet Union.\n\nSince Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, the Baltic states have been the loudest voices sounding the alarm about the existential threat posed by Russia , and all three countries increased their military spending to more than 2% of their GDP, and recently agreed to raise it to 3% .\n\nBuilding shared defences\n\nAmid growing security concerns, the defence ministers in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia also agreed in January to set up a common Baltic defence zone on their borders with Russia and Belarus . This would consist of building physical defensive structures such as bunkers.\n\nEstonia will begin construction of 600 bunkers in early 2025 . The nations will also cooperate in developing missile artillery, and ensuring that their equipment, ammunition and manpower is updated .\n\nA protest against the Russian invasion of Ukraine held at the Freedom Cross, Tallinn, Estonia, which commemorates Estonia's period of independence between the first and beginning of the second world war. Sopa/Alamy\n\nEstonia has also doubled the size of its territorial defence force to 20,000 people , while Latvia reintroduced conscription in 2023 after becoming the only Baltic state to stop mandatory military service in 2006.\n\nLatvia also plans to double the size of its armed forces to 61,000 by the year 2032 . Meanwhile, Lithuania has made an agreement with Germany to allow a permanent brigade of 4,800 of its troops to be combat ready on the Russian border by 2027 .\n\nPutin's pledge to Russian speakers\n\nBut given that Russia borders 14 countries, why are the Baltic states especially concerned about their security? In addition to being geographically close, a notable number of ethnic Russians live in the Baltic countries (5% in Lithuania; 25% in Estonia and 36% in Latvia . In the eastern Estonian city of Narva, 95.7% of the population are native Russian speakers and 87.7% are ethnic Russians .\n\nThis matters as Putin has argued that having substantial numbers of ethnic Russians living outside of Russia, due to the\u201ccatastrophic\u201d dissolution of the Soviet Union, represents a\u201chumanitarian disaster of epic proportions\u201d as it left Russians cut off from\u201ctheir motherland\u201d. Putin has vowed to actively protect all\u201cRussians\u201d living abroad .\n\nIn particular, Putin has said he was concerned about how ethnic Russians are being treated in the Baltics, remarking that the deportation of ethnic Russians (most notably in Latvia where there have been recent changes to its immigration laws), poses a threat to Russian national security .\n\nThe Kremlin has also protested the demolition of Soviet monuments in the Baltics , placing Estonia's prime minster, Kaja Kallas, on its wanted list for doing so.\n\nBut these claims about wanting to protect Russians abroad, are really just a pretext to justify escalation with the Baltics, which will test Nato's alliance and destabilise the organisation . So it's not just important that there are ethnic Russians living there \u2013 there are strategic reasons as well that make them an easy target.\n\nEven with the Baltic countries strengthening their troop numbers, Russia currently has 1.32 million active military personnel, and two million active reserve . Combined this is greater that Lithuania's entire population of 2.8 million people, and far greater than Estonia and Latvia which have populations of 1.3 million and 1.8 million people, respectively.\n\nRead more: The EU should stop 'westsplaining' and listen to its smaller eastern members \u2013 they saw the Ukraine war coming\n\nFor Lithuania, which borders Belarus and Russian-run mini-state Kaliningrad, there are concerns that it could be taken over first by Russian forces, which would then physically isolate Lithuania from the rest of the Baltics. The Kaliningrad region has become increasingly militarised in recent years, with Iskander ballistic missiles and S-400 systems installed. With Trump suggesting he would weaken the US's commitment to Nato if elected, there won't be much of a deterrent for Putin to grab low-hanging fruit.\n\nThe current Nato response force consists of approximately 40,000 troops , with plans to upgrade to 300,000 troops . But quick-reaction units could still be too slow to protect the Baltics from Russian forces as, ironically, moving large units, vehicles and ammunition across borders is bureaucratic and takes time . It would be important to have excellent intelligence and to move quickly, something that will be made more difficult with the US potentially opting out of its commitments.\n\nThough Russia has plunged much of its resources into winning the Ukraine war, Putin still aims to expand Russian sovereignty across the post-Soviet states and to effectively dismantle Nato, something that Trump takes no issue with. As Russia has been ramping up its war machine, the Baltic states firmly believe that Russian aggression will not stop at Ukraine, and that they could be next .",

            "text": "During the House Oversight Committee hearing, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez veered into a peculiar exchange with key witness Tony Bobulinski, a former business associate of Hunter Biden. The congresswoman seemed to have a tough time when Bobulinski didn\u2019t give her the answers she was looking for regarding President Joe Biden\u2019s alleged acts of crime. She went on to claim that \u201cRICO is not a crime,\u201d which clashed with the examples provided by Bobulinski during the hearing.\n\nAOCD had her ugly a$$ handed to her but her overinflated ego won't stop her from doubling down. Go bar to the bar.https://t.co/jtm6kqT386 \u2014 JJ Pesavento (@rdrhwke) March 21, 2024\n\nThis sparked quite the commotion on social media, with even Senator Ted Cruz chiming in and reposting the video clip of AOC\u2019s \u201cRICO is not a crime\u201d claim. The senator, known for his extensive legal background and a knack for causing a stir, didn\u2019t hold back. He not only labeled the exchange as \u201cbizarre\u201d but also took the opportunity to educate AOC and the public by affirming that RICO is, without a doubt, a crime, backing it up with the statute number and reminding everyone of the severe penalties associated with it.\n\nAOC wasn\u2019t about to let Cruz have the last word. She fired back with a repost of the senator\u2019s tweet, confidently declaring him \u201cWrong!\u201d and attempting to divert the focus onto the Democrats\u2019 narrative concerning the lack of evidence against the Biden family from the House Republicans.\n\nThe congresswoman\u2019s slight of hand with words was no doubt in defense of the president and his family, playing down the seriousness of the RICO statute in a way that\u2019s akin to saying stealing isn\u2019t a crime. It\u2019s like saying stealing has different classifications, such as burglary, larceny, embezzlement, robbery, hence, it\u2019s not a crime. Come on, AOC, that\u2019s a stretch!\n\nAOC\u2019s retort quickly stirred up a storm of over 4,000 replies and reposts, with many folks sharing additional information about the RICO statute and highlighting Cruz\u2019s legal expertise. It seems like there\u2019s a bit of a mismatch here between a former bartender and a seasoned Harvard law graduate and former Supreme Court clerk\u2014no contest there!\n\nMoving away from the drama, it\u2019s worth noting that Bobulinski and Jason Galanis, another witness at the hearing, delved into evidence of corruption, particularly relating to then Vice President Biden\u2019s involvement. Some former associates have been vocal about Biden\u2019s influence and access being leveraged for their business dealings.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget Senator Cruz\u2019s podcast, \u201cThe Verdict,\u201d where he doesn\u2019t hold back in discussing the Biden family\u2019s alleged corruption and the evidence implicating President Biden himself. It seems like there\u2019s a lot more to unpack here as the drama continues to unfold.",

            "text": "In our poll, 100% of the Republicans who said they got their news from Fox News or other conservative sources said they intended to support Trump in the general election. This stands in contrast to Republicans whose main media sources are outlets like CNN and major news organizations: 79% of them plan to vote for Trump, and 13% said they planned to vote for President Joe Biden.\n\nThis division could affect his standing among Republicans in the general electorate \u2014 a decidedly different group from GOP primary voters. That is in line with research that shows that changing the media habits of Fox News consumers may actually change their views.\n\nRepublicans who get their news from nonconservative mainstream media outlets are less likely to support Donald Trump than those who follow conservative outlets. And sizable numbers from the first group say they think Trump acted criminally, according to a recent New York Times/Siena College poll.\n\nGet Breaking News Alerts Stay up-to-date with important news developments, delivered right to your inbox. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAnd across many measures, mainstream media Republicans are less supportive of Trump. They are 20 percentage points less likely than conservative media Republicans to say they are enthusiastic about Trump as the party\u2019s nominee and more than 30 percentage points less likely to say Trump\u2019s policies have helped them personally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite the perception that most Republicans watch Fox News, the share of Republicans who said they got their news from sources like CNN and major newspapers was similar to the share who said they primarily consumed conservative media \u2014 roughly 30% in each case.\n\nThese Republicans differ from consumers of conservative media primarily in terms of their ideology: They were much more likely to describe themselves as politically moderate. Nikki Haley had about 30% support among these Republicans and 4% among conservative media consumers (the poll was taken before Haley dropped out of the race).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nResearchers have long pondered a kind of chicken-and-egg question with conservatism and conservative media: Does watching more conservative media change your views, or are you more attracted to it because of your views? Two political scientists, David Broockman at the University of California, Berkeley and Joshua Kalla at Yale University, conducted an experiment trying to answer that question.\n\n\u201cWe know from our other research that many Fox News viewers are in an echo chamber and are quite conservative,\u201d Broockman said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of skepticism that strong partisans could not be persuaded, and we wanted to challenge that assumption.\u201d\n\nIn their experiment, they randomly assigned Fox News viewers to watch CNN for a month, comparing their political views after they switched to the network with Fox viewers who did not make the switch. The result? Getting conservative news viewers to watch mainstream news caused many of the participants to shift away from hard-right views on a number of issues like immigration and race relations. And they found changes in how participants evaluated Trump.\n\n\u201cIt was amazing to see that the study participants learned new facts about the world from watching CNN,\u201d Kalla said. \u201cThese are people who don\u2019t trust CNN; they think it\u2019s propaganda and fiction.\n\n\u201cThe fact that they find that these people, in particular, learn something new about the world suggests that they\u2019re more open to persuasion and hearing the other side than we might assume.\u201d\n\nParticipants did not just move toward moderate views on issues like immigration; they also started to question their trust in Fox News itself. At the end of the study, respondents were less likely to agree with the statement: \u201cIf Donald Trump did something bad, Fox News would discuss it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExperiments like this have little real-world application, but they do reinforce the notion that conservative news viewers see the current political landscape through a different lens.\n\nThis extends to how Republicans are thinking about the criminal charges their party\u2019s nominee faces. Republicans who consume nonconservative mainstream media were more likely to say that the charges against Trump were legitimate, that Trump knowingly made false claims about the election being stolen and that he should be found guilty in the election interference trial in Washington, according to a December survey.\n\nAnd in the recent survey, the gap between the two types of Republicans persists. Republicans who watch mainstream media are more than three times as likely to say Trump acted criminally as those who consume conservative media. And the share of mainstream media Republicans saying this has grown over the last two years, reaching a peak of 43% in December. It is now down to 34%.\n\n\u201cI do think that concealing private documents with perhaps the intent to disseminate them is to an extent treason,\u201d said Briana Dunbar, 20, a political science student at Ohio State who says she is considering supporting Trump in the fall. \u201cIf he is found guilty, I will not vote for him.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m not the judge, and it\u2019s not up to me,\u201d added Dunbar, who said she gets most of her news from ABC News or her political science classes. \u201cOnce the ruling comes down, I will trust what they say. If he\u2019s not guilty, that\u2019s probably who I would vote for. But November is a ways away.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile a notable share of these mainstream media Republicans say they do not plan to back Trump, many could ultimately decide to vote for him in November. In 2016, after the infamous \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape, in which Trump was recorded boasting about groping women, many in the party considered deserting him. Even most of those voters found a way back to their party\u2019s nominee.\n\nAmong conservative media Republicans, the share who said Trump did not commit crimes has remained largely unchanged.\n\nNateasha Friesen, 56, of Fresno, California, is an avid consumer of news from places like Newsmax and The Epoch Times, news outlets that she says are \u201cnot the media telling me what to think and instead allowing me to make an educated decision for myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cI triangulate the information that I\u2019m getting, with a focus on figuring out what their sources are and the transparency that they\u2019re providing,\u201d she said.\n\nFriesen plans to support Trump in the fall. \u201cMy views on this have been very steady: He has not committed any crimes. I\u2019m pretty confident the trials are politically motivated.\u201d\n\nAbout 10% of independents say they watch conservative news, and nearly all of them say they lean toward the Republican Party.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA much smaller group of Republicans surveyed \u2014 around 13% \u2014 primarily got their news from social media. This group supported Trump at a rate as high as those consuming conservative media, but they were more inclined to agree with mainstream media Republicans that Trump committed crimes. Still, this group saw the charges as primarily politically motivated.\n\nBut these social media Republicans were far younger than other Republicans. They were also less likely to say they planned to vote in November.\n\n______\n\nThe New York Times/Siena College poll of 980 registered voters nationwide was conducted on cellular and landline telephones, using live interviewers, from Feb. 25 to 28, 2024.

            "text": "Human trafficking is repugnant. It\u2019s a form of slavery where the trafficker uses force, fraud, or threats to make victims take part in commercial sex or forced labor. Trafficking affects thousands of people in the US every year.\n\nIt\u2019s a form of crime that Joe Biden really hates. And the Biden administration has taken many steps to stop it.\n\nThe White House recently summarized the work being done. Some of these efforts are ongoing; others are new.\n\nFirst step: increasing awareness. We need to be able to spot trafficking before we can fight it!\n\nThe Department of Labor is investing more resources in identifying forced labor and child labor risks in the products that are part of our everyday lives to ensure that we avoid importing those goods into the United States. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will publish the National Human Trafficking Prevention Framework with violence prevention strategies and approaches for communities to stop human trafficking before it occurs, reduce its impact, and prevent it from recurring. The Department of State (State) will launch a training resource that focuses on how to conduct trauma-informed interviews and conversations for personnel at our embassies and consulates who may interview or converse with survivors of human trafficking.\n\nSecond step: protection. This involves both preventing this crime and caring for its survivors.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will select a Senior Victim-Centered Approach Official to further institutionalize victim identification and support capacity across the Department. DHS will also launch an online application and processing system for U.S. law enforcement nationwide to expedite and expand its ability to request Continued Presence for human trafficking victims. State will launch a new foreign assistance program, the Partnership to Prevent (P2P) Human Trafficking. This new program, like the Child Protection Compact Partnerships, will fund multi-year commitments developed jointly by the United States and selected partner countries. These document shared objectives to advance national and local level efforts to effectively prevent trafficking, prosecute traffickers, and provide trauma-informed care for survivors. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) will support foreign governments and civil society efforts to combat human trafficking with survivor-centered approaches. HHS will continue to connect thousands of survivors of human trafficking to housing, health, and other critical services through a national network of community-based organizations.\n\nThe third big step: prosecution. The Biden administration is targeting traffickers at home and overseas.\n\nThe Department of Treasury will hold traffickers accountable by working with interagency partners to develop targeted sanctions to disrupt human trafficking activities. Since December 2022, Treasury has designated 23 persons for conduct related to human trafficking, including for serious human rights abuse aboard People\u2019s Republic of China-flagged distant water fishing vessels, and for systemic and pervasive sex trafficking activity. The Department of the Interior will continue to work with the United States Attorneys\u2019 Offices and state law enforcement officials to establish standard law enforcement response protocols throughout Indian Country. This year, the Department will also be completing a cloud-based Solution Trust Accountability Tracker (STAT). STAT catalogues information on missing persons, murder, and human trafficking cases relating to Native American and Alaska Native victims. The Department of Justice (DOJ) will continue bringing high-impact sex trafficking and labor trafficking prosecutions in partnership with federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial law enforcement partners. In addition, DOJ will launch a Human Trafficking Strategic Initiative of the Organized Crime and Drug Enforcement Task Force. It will mobilize additional federal, state, and local law enforcement partners in investigations involving transnational organized and gang-related human trafficking threats.\n\nIs there still more work to be done? 100%! Lots more work. But Biden has done so much more than many people guessed could be done. He deserves a lot of credit. AND he deserves to be re-elected.\n\nWhat can you do to help?\n\nYour donation will come bundled with others from our Good News community and will show Biden that there are many of us who support him and combine hard work with optimism in our battles for a better America!\n\nWant to do something else?\n\nRec and comment on these posts to keep them alive at DKos and share them with others who might not realize how great a president Joe Biden has been.\n\nLooking for something else? Here are some other ideas:\n\nThis is an entry in my ongoing series Boosting Biden.\n\nCheck the comments for more information on how to find other entries and subscribe.\n\nThese posts are written by GoodNewsRoundup (Goodie),\n\nedited by Matilda Briggs, and supported by 2thanks and WolverineForTJatAW\n\nas well as several other notable Kossacks.\n\nAs with all good things, it takes a village.",

            "text": "Trump Must Sue Letitia James Over Her Prosecution Of A Crime With No Victim and a Crime That Wasn\u2019t Committed.\n\nThanks in part to the political naivette of James Trump gets more and more popular every second. It\u2019s supposedly because Trump claimed the value of some of his properties was too high in Letitia James estimate or her opinion. No one was harmed by trumps evaluation so there was no victim so there was no crime. ***** According to the conduct of Donald Trump alleged by James, the financial statements compiled by Trump \u2013 which were offered to banks and other entities Trump was doing business with \u2013 include values of assets that were blatantly contradicted by internal records or otherwise falsified. BUT THEY WERE ESTIMATES, NOT CONTRACTUAL ELEMENTS!!! \u201cAll told, Mr. Trump, the Trump Organization, and the other Defendants, as part of a repeated pattern and common scheme, derived more than 200 false and misleading valuations of assets included in the 11 Statements covering 2011 through 2021,\u201d the lawsuit said. The lawsuit failed to provide the specific property or properties and the actual value of any damage caused. No crime victim has surfaced. To repeat James has been unable to identify any crime victim. No victim: No crime! Letitia James Committed Crimes Against Trump James characterized one of the episodes as a \u201ctwo sets of books\u201d scenario: \u201cone internal set of records reached one conclusion regarding market value, but the figure presented on Mr. Trump\u2019s Statement was considerably higher.\u201d James claims that Trump reaped a \u201csubstantial\u201d financial benefit by putting forward faulty information in his financial statements, including $150 million in the form of favorable interest rates he obtained from the banks that James said his team misled. No financial benefit that came from a victim was identified by the rabid prosecutor. The alleged schemes allegedly touch a variety of Trump properties, including golf courses, hotels and Mar-a-Lago. James said the misrepresentations on Trump\u2019s financial statements affected \u201cmost if not all of\u201d his and his company\u2019s \u201creal estate holdings in any given year, including several of Trump\u2019s highest profile business ventures. Trump valued his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida as high as $739 million when the property was likely worth about a tenth of that, James alleged, while accusing Trump of further boosting the resort\u2019s value by tacking on a \u201cbrand premium.\u201d The trouble with James characterizations is she is not an expert nor has any victim been found nor has any victim appeared\u2026 No Victim/No Crime!\u2026 Maliscious Prosecution by a rabid prosecutor with an agenda but no victim. US accounting principles prohibit such premiums and the Trump financial statements \u201cexpressly claim to exclude brand value,\u201d James said. Included in the 2011 valuation of Trump\u2019s Westchester golf course in New York was the notion that new members would pay $200,000 in initiation fees, even though Trump instructed the club to reduce or waive those fees in a bid to increase club membership numbers, according to the lawsuit. The defendants are accused of skewing the worth of the Trump Park Avenue property, by putting a value on several units that was roughly six times more than what an outside firm calculated in an 2010 appraisal. James pointed to testimony from Donald Trump Jr., one of the defendants, that indicated the company was aware that the units were rent stabilized, which is the reason the appraiser had put them at the much lower value. Other Trump ventures \u2013 including his Doral golf resort in Florida, the Old Post Office property he leased for a hotel in Washington, and Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago \u2013 are implicated in the lawsuit, with James saying that loans were extended for those properties because of inaccurate representations the Trump team made to banks but no bank was found that thought they were decieved or cheated. James is out of control and must be replaced. In fact, james has opened herself up to maliscious posecution charges. James also claimed that the Trump financial statements describes profits from real estate properties as being part of Trump\u2019s liquid assets when they were in fact cash held by a real estate trust, Vornado Partnerships, in which Trump had a minority stake. Doing so contradicted both US accounting principles (known as generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP), according to the complaint. But accounting practices are not part of the criminal code and accounting practices as practiced by Trump and other practicioners are standard in the industry. \u201cIn some years these restricted funds accounted for almost one-third of all the cash reported by Mr. Trump,\u201d the lawsuit said. Trump\u2019s statements falsely claimed he had outside help for valuing assets, lawsuit says The lawsuit said that \u201cno outside professionals were retained to prepare any of the asset valuations\u201d that were presented in his annual financial statements, despite representations on those statements that the evaluations were done with \u201coutside professionals.\u201d \u201cTo the extent Mr. Trump and the Trump Organization received any advice from outside professionals that had any bearing on how to approach valuing the assets, they routinely ignored or contradicted such advice,\u201d the complaint said. Jeffrey McConney \u2013 a Trump Organization executive and a defendant in the lawsuit \u2013 was asked by the attorney general\u2019s office in a 2020 interview about the references to outside professionals on the Trump financial statements, according to the lawsuit. \u201cAfter that interview, the Trump Organization changed the wording for the 2020 Statement, omitting any representation that any particular valuation was reached in consultation with \u2018outside professionals\u2019 and instead listing outside professionals as merely one factor that may have been \u2018applicable\u2019 in some unspecified manner,\u201d James\u2019 complaint said. In no case was there a victim who was victimized nor any victim who complained about trumps practices. No Victim/No Crime! Not only did Trump not cheat anyone, he paid everyone. James needs to go! G\u2019wan now go.. Trumps attorney, \u201cIt is abundantly clear that the Attorney General\u2019s Office has exceeded its statutory authority by prying into transactions where absolutely no wrongdoing has taken place,\u201d Trump Attorney Alina Habba said. \u201cWe are confident that our judicial system will not stand for this unchecked abuse of authority, and we look forward to defending our client against each and every one of the Attorney General\u2019s meritless claims.\u201d Visits: 0",

Missouri, a Supreme Court case that originated from a lawsuit filed by state attorneys general from Missouri and Louisiana accusing government officials of colluding with social media companies to censor posts online.\n\nBILL MAHER, JOHN CLEESE RAIL AGAINST THE NEW YORK TIMES: \u2018SAD\u2019 IT'S NO LONGER A \u2018GREAT NEWSPAPER\u2019\n\nThese allegedly censored posts included statements about COVID-19 and Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop, among other topics.\n\nSwisher pushed back on Maher\u2019s points, noting that it was a confusing time for everyone.\n\nMaher said earlier in the interview that he \"was always on the page during the pandemic that they should not be shutting down debate about medical matters.\"\n\n\"I was a dissenter on many of these issues,\" he said, before noting that there were valuable opinions that were silenced or discouraged at the height of the pandemic.\n\nFacebook \u2014 now Meta \u2014 owner Mark Zuckerberg said last year that the \"establishment\u2026 kind of waffled on a bunch of facts and asked for a bunch of things to be censored that, in retrospect, ended up being more debatable or true.\"\n\nOn \"Real Time,\" Swisher told Maher that \"we\u2019re not going to know perfectly.\"\n\nThe host continued, providing examples of where speech on the topic was discouraged.\n\n\"OK, but we should have been able to argue about whether it came from a lab, which we weren\u2019t. Things like that,\" he said. \"Natural immunity \u2014 whether it was better to go to the beach and get sun and fresh air, as I would have said, as opposed to sitting home and day-drinking and putting on weight.\"\n\nREP. NANCY MACE SPARS WITH BILL MAHER OVER, EXPLAINS HER SHIFT TOWARDS TRUMP: \u2018WE\u2019VE HAD THREE YEARS OF BIDEN'\n\n\"They never mentioned that obesity was the biggest factor,\" Maher continued. \"They have a lot to answer for.\"\n\nSwisher replied: \"They do, but you\u2019re in the middle of a plague and a debate that people don\u2019t know, and so you\u2019re going to\u2026 \"\n\nMaher cut her off: \"Yes, so you should be able to debate it \u2014 this is medicine.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Yes you should,\" Swisher responded. \"This is not \u00ad\u2014 the moment was not \u2014 people make mistakes, and science says it makes mistakes.\"\n\nMaher explained more background about the lawsuit.\n\n\"There were two doctors, Jay Bhattacharya and Martin Kulldorff. They\u2019re from Stanford and Harvard, and they said, \u2018We were shut down. Not always fully, but there are ways to do that.\u2019\"\n\n\"And they\u2019re not radicals,\" he said. \"They were saying that we\u2019re going too far with school closures \u2014 again, I think, has been proved right. My question was always, \u2018Why are your doctors more important than my doctors, the ones I want to listen to?'\"\n\n\"And the social media companies were in the tank with the government,\" Maher said.",

Democrats fear growing opposition at home could hurt his chances in November's presidential election.\n\nNetanyahu said in a statement after the call that he had reiterated \"Israel's commitment to achieving all of the war's objectives.\"\n\nThe Israeli premier cited the objectives as eliminating Hamas, release of all the hostages and \"ensuring that Gaza will never present a threat to Israel.\"\n\nHe also pointed to the provision of \"essential humanitarian aid that helps achieve these aims.\"\n\nIsrael began relentless bombardment in Gaza, alongside a ground offensive, after Palestinian militant group Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack, which left about 1,160 dead in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official figures.\n\nThe militants also seized hostages, around 130 of whom Israel believes remain in Gaza, including 33 presumed dead.\n\nNearly 32,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the war began, most of them women and children, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.\n\nAs tensions with Netanyahu escalated, Biden pointedly praised a \"good speech\" last week by Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer calling for new elections in Israel.\n\nWith the UN warning of imminent famine in Gaza, Biden earlier this month ordered the US military to start airdrops of food into the enclave, and is sending American forces to build a temporary port for maritime aid.",

This was in response to a report from the New York Times showing that the CIA was all over Ukraine.\n\nOn Thursday night, Benz released a new video clip arguing that that Hunter Biden was advancing a CIA project in Ukraine to swing the natural gas market towards NATO and that\u2019s why he\u2019s untouchable.\n\nHere is the transcript from the video on X.\n\nMike Benz: I just have to break this down in a video to make it perfectly plain and clear to people what\u2019s happening with Hunter Biden and the CIA. Why was I saying a year and a half ago that the reason Hunter Biden is untouchable by the Justice Department is because he was part of a CIA operation. Multiple ones, actually.\n\nYou have to understand what\u2019s going on here. Let me just give you a dozen data points on Hunter Biden CIA. The first thing is, Hunter was on the Chairman\u2019s Advisory Board of the National Democratic Institute, the NDI. The NDI is the DNC wing of the National Endowment for Democracy, which is the top CIA cutout used in our tens of thousands of NGO swarms. NED ranks number one. It was created to be the NGO affiliate of the CIA. It was created to do overtly what the CIA was doing covertly and getting in trouble for doing in the 20th century, created under the Reagan administration in 1983. There\u2019s something called the NDI for Democrats and the for Republicans, the CIA wing of the Republican Party. They both split spoils, basically on US foreign policy jobs that the CIA orchestrates.\n\nYou don\u2019t get to be part of the chairman\u2019s advisory committee of the NDI unless you are CIA-linked or CIA-vetted. It is a CIA. \u2013 NGOs, government-organized, non-governmental organizations. This is a CIA-organize a CIA-organized, non-CIA organization. It\u2019s the CIA. He\u2019s on the chairman\u2019s advisory board of that. By the way, when he was at Burisma, who was the other person on the Barisma board from the US there was Cofer Black, who had spent 30 years in the CIA. Cofer Black was Mitt Romney\u2019s Sherpa to the intelligence community during his presidential run in 2012. You know what? Mitt Romney is on the board of the IRI, who I just mentioned, the International Republican Institute, the CIA cut out counterpart to the NDI. Barisma was a CIA operation. Let me say this again. Burisma was a CIA operation. So was Naftagas. That\u2019s the public and then, respectively, the private and public natural gas companies there. There were a couple of other private ones in addition to Burisma. But the CIA was trying to break down Gazprom and swing the gas market from Russia to NATO. They\u2019ve been trying to do this for 16 friggin\u2019 years.\n\nIt\u2019s been an in-process CIA, State Department, Pentagon project for 16 frigging years. They were trying to capacity build Burisma and shift its board to make it US-controlled. They\u2019re doing the same thing simultaneously with Naftogaz, the feeder that Burisma feeds into. You can even read about the power struggle between George Soros and Vladimir Putin for control over Naftogaz, the state-owned titan that has been the privatization prize of the IMF. That is, that was part of the reason that we overthrew the Ukrainian government in 2014, is to privatize those assets because we knew that we were going to be cutting Russia off. So Western stakeholders wanted to profit from this trillion-dollar windfall if Russia could be kicked out the European energy market.\n\nThis is common activity for the Central Intelligence Agency, which was created by corporate lawyers in 1947 as its first class. The corporate espionage side of the CIA operation here has geopolitical dimensions. If you kill Russia\u2019s energy exports, you kill their military, which means you kill their ability to run air defense systems to Syria. You kill their ability to run small arms to sub-Saharan Africa to oppose US control over lithium and cobalt and copper and aluminum and gold and oil and gas there, too.\n\nThis was a long-range CIA project where Hunter Biden happened to be ass deep in exactly the number one geopolitical target of what the CIA was doing under the Obama administration, which is trying to kill Russia\u2019s energy exports. Meanwhile, you had this endogenous Ukrainian gas company that Hunter\u2019s on the board of. By the way, who\u2019s Hunter\u2019s dad at the time? It\u2019s Joe Biden, the vice President in charge of the Ukraine portfolio. But Joe Biden spent 30 10 years on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, 10 years rotating between chairman and ranking member. That is the coordinating wing of the Senate with the State Department and the CIA. It\u2019s specifically Central and Eastern Europe. Joe Biden was hugely involved in the Yugoslavia operation in the late 1990s, and breaking that up, which again was a CIA job, okay? That\u2019s why you have to understand the structure of the blob. Whenever you see the State Department, the CIA CIA is there and the Pentagon are there, and you just don\u2019t see it yet. Whenever you see the CIA, the State Department and the Pentagon there, you just don\u2019t see it yet. Even British intelligence is all over this LNG story.\n\nYou don\u2019t get British intelligence without US intelligence. The fact is, the CIA will lean on the Justice Department. I just did six hours of subscriber streams about the relationship between CIA and DOJ, and that the CIA will lean on DOJ to kill investigations into criminal activity involving assets of the CIA so that they can continue to do work that\u2019s in the US national interest, even if it\u2019s a criminal enterprise.\n\nBecause the CIA has a license to do that. They have the license to crime under NSC 10-2. They\u2019re licensed to do criminal activity as long as it\u2019s plausibly deniable. Hunter Biden was a part of a plausibly deniable CIA operation to swing the gas market towards That\u2019s why it\u2019s untouchable.",

In contrast, they eagerly played groupies for the Biden regime with puff pieces on Biden\u2019s microchips visit to Arizona and a new tranche of student loan forgiveness.\n\nThe eye-rolling hackery began with Biden\u2019s trip to the swing state of Arizona to promote the CHIPS and Science Act. ABC\u2019s World News Tonight anchor David Muir sounded like a White House press secretary in a tease: \u201cThe race for the White House tonight. President Biden in Arizona, a key battleground, revealing $20 billion in investments in American jobs, bringing computer chip-making back to America from Taiwan and elsewhere.\u201d\n\nAfter a similar spiel in the segment, senior White House correspondent Selina Wang beamed over \u201cBiden taking on the top issue for voters \u2014 the economy \u2014 announcing a major deal to bring computer chip-making back to America\u201d with \u201cnearly $20 billion to fund production of semiconductor chips in four states\u201d.\n\nAdding that such \u201c[c]hips\u2026power everything from your phone to your car\u201d and a few mangled Biden soundbites later, she touted Biden \u201cdrawing a clear contrast with\u201d Trump.\n\nWang also tacked on the Biden team \u201cunveiling the strictest car emissions in history\u201d that would force \u201cmost new cars sold in America\u201d to \u201cbe electric\u201d come 2032 and would \u201ccombat climate change\u201d even if it\u2019d be \u201ca political loaded move.\u201d\n\nNBC Nightly News had the other microchips press release. Anchor Lester Holt sounded like Muir: \u201cA big announcement from President Biden in battleground Arizona. Billions in tech grants that will bring tens of thousands of new jobs at a time when many voters say the state needs an economic jump start.\u201d\n\nChief business correspondent and former longtime CNN host Christine Romans went to Arizona for the \u201cmultibillion dollar delivery\u201d that included \u201c$8.5 billion in grants and 11 billion more in loans to semiconductor manufacturer Intel, money from the bipartisan CHIPS Act passed in 2022\u201d\n\n\u201cHere in Chandler, Arizona, 6,000 construction workers are building two CHIPS Plants known as FABs projected to host 3,000 manufacturing jobs. Intel\u2019s CEO Pat Gelsinger says the government investment is essential to competing with China,\u201d she added before using a nearby restaurant to promote the economic benefits.\n\nRomans later conceded housing and general costs of living in states like Arizona have soared, but concluded on a hopeful note that this was \u201cwhy he\u2019s highlighting bills like the bipartisan CHIPS Act\u201d.\n\nShifting to Thursday, all three morning shows excitedly promoted Biden\u2019s new handout to voters. ABC had Wang back on the case for Good Morning America and cheered Biden being \u201ceager to show this core group of voters that he has not given up\u201d on them (click \u201cexpand\u201d):\n\nGEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: To Washington now where the Biden administration is announcing a new round of student debt relief for tens of thousands of borrowers who currently work in public service. Senior White House correspondent Selena Wang has the details. Good morning, Selina.\n\nWANG: Hey, good morning George. So, the President is announcing more student loan relief, focusing on key campaign promise. This morning, the President \u2014 he\u2019s canceling nearly $6 billion in student debt for 78,000 public service workers. Now, these are nurses, teachers, firefighters, and others who are currently enrolled in the public service loan forgiveness program. And they\u2019ll soon be getting an e-mail from the President telling them about this relief. Now, with this latest move, the White House says this administration has canceled a total of $144 billion in debt for nearly four million Americans and they say that another nearly 400,000 public service workers \u2014 they are on-track to have their student loans forgiven in the coming two years. Now, last year, remember, the Supreme Court had struck down Biden\u2019s original plan to cancel $10,000 for all borrowers making less than $125,000 a year. But the President has found ways around that to cancel more student debt for borrowers. Now, with the general election heating up, this President is eager to show this core group of voters that he has not given up yet. This morning, again vowing to use the tools he can to cancel more student debt for more Americans and borrowers[.]\n\nCBS Mornings had senior White House and campaign correspondent Ed O\u2019Keefe relay administration talking points, noting Biden\u2019s upcoming e-mail to those close to debt forgiveness was \u201ca sign of how the President\u2019s trying to take a little more credit for the program in a tough election year\u201d with the broader forgiveness moves \u201cthe kind of thing that helps mobilize voters in November.\u201d\n\nClearly trying to paint the Biden economy as a winner, co-host Nate Burleson paired that with \u201cmore good economic news\u201d in the form of record stock market highs and a possible cut in interest rates later this year.\n\nNBC\u2019s Today made it three-for-three on Biden\u2019s attempted buying of votes thanks to a 29-second news brief from weekend co-host Laura Jarrett (and daughter of longtime Obama family confidant, Valerie Jarrett) touting what \u201cBiden says\u201d was \u201crelief that [borrowers] were entitled under the law.\u201d\n\nTo see the relevant transcripts form March 20, click here (for ABC) and here (for NBC).

Please enter a valid email address.\n\nFIRST ON FOX: Former President Trump's campaign heavily criticized the Biden administration's newly finalized regulations targeting gas-powered cars on Wednesday, vowing to overturn the action.\n\nIn a statement to Fox News Digital, the Trump campaign said the climate regulations \u2014 unveiled by the White House and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on Wednesday \u2014 would force Americans to buy expensive electric vehicles (EV) and reduce consumer choice. The campaign further vowed that Trump would immediately strike down the regulations if he bests President Biden in their election rematch later this year.\n\n\"Joe Biden's extreme electric vehicle mandate will force Americans to buy ultra-expensive cars they do not want and cannot afford while destroying the U.S. auto industry in the process,\" Trump campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News Digital in a statement. \"This radical policy is anti-jobs, anti-consumer and anti-American.\"\n\n\"It will destroy the livelihoods of countless U.S. autoworkers while sending the U.S. auto industry to China. President Trump will reverse Joe Biden's extreme electric vehicle mandate on Day One.\"\n\nVULNERABLE HOUSE DEM BUCKS PARTY ORTHODOXY, BLASTING HIS STATE'S PROPOSED EV MANDATE\n\nThe statement comes months after Trump took aim at the Biden administration's climate agenda over its impact on blue-collar rank-and-file autoworkers. During the United Auto Workers strike last year, the former president said the best interests of American workers were his \"number one concern,\" and that a forced EV transition would destroy the U.S. auto industry.\n\nVIRGINIA DEMOCRATS UPHOLD STATE'S EV MANDATE DESPITE GROWING OPPOSITION: 'DEFY COMMON SENSE'\n\nMeanwhile, under the regulations unveiled Wednesday, the federal government will enforce the most stringent tailpipe emissions restrictions ever finalized beginning with model year 2027 light-duty and medium-duty vehicles. Those regulations are slated to progressively ramp up through 2032, forcing most new car purchases to be battery electric and plug-in hybrid within that time frame.\n\nIn one \"low cost\" model EPA outlined in the rule, administration officials said automakers would be forced to ensure 56% of light-duty car sales are battery electric and another 13% are hybrid by 2032, meaning nearly 70% of new cars would be zero-emissions or low-emissions by then.\n\n\"Three years ago, I set an ambitious target: that half of all new cars and trucks sold in 2030 would be zero-emission,\" Biden said in a statement after the regulations were posted Wednesday.\n\n\"I brought together American automakers. I brought together American autoworkers,\" he said. \"Together, we\u2019ve made historic progress. Hundreds of new expanded factories across the country. Hundreds of billions in private investment and thousands of good-paying union jobs. And we\u2019ll meet my goal for 2030 and race forward in the years ahead.\"\n\n130+ HOUSE, SENATE REPUBLICANS JOIN FORCES IN OPPOSITION OF BIDEN'S UPCOMING EV MANDATE\n\nThe EPA regulations, though, were immediately blasted by the energy industry, farm groups, consumer advocates and Republican lawmakers who vowed to pursue legislation aimed at overturning the rules.\n\nAccording to the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an association that represents major automakers, 9.3% of total car purchases in the U.S. last year were electric or plug-in hybrids \u2014 up from 7% in 2022. That uptick was driven largely by purchases in California and urban areas where the majority of EV purchases are made.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAt the same time, EVs remain far more expensive than traditional, gas-powered cars. Even factoring in generous federal and state subsidies, the average cost of an EV is about $52,500, while the average subcompact car costs $24,000.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment when contacted by Fox News Digital.",

            "text": "Trump lags behind Biden in campaign cash reserves while legal bills mount\n\nPresident Biden\u2019s campaign continues to boast a significant cash advantage over Donald Trump\u2019s, as the former president juggles the burdens of fundraising for his bid to return to office and paying his mounting legal bills seven months before the general election.\n\nFederal Election Commission reports filed on Wednesday did not offer a full picture of the comparative strength of the two campaigns, because several of the groups raising money for each presumptive nominee will not disclose their latest totals with the FEC until April.\n\nBut the Biden campaign demonstrated a clear fundraising advantage over Trump in filings Wednesday night, reporting $71 million in cash on hand to Trump\u2019s $33.5 million \u2014 more than double his rival\u2019s reserves. Biden\u2019s campaign widened the gap from the end of January, when it led Trump\u2019s campaign $56 million to $30.5 million.\n\nThe reports underscore the extent to which Trump\u2019s legal troubles are putting a strain on his campaign. Save America, the political action committee that the Trump campaign has been using to pay the legal bills for the former president and many of his associates, spent more than it raised in February \u2014 with the vast majority of its spending going to legal costs.\n\nThe Save America PAC reported about $4 million in cash on hand at the end of February. It spent about $7 million over the same period, including $5.6 million paid to lawyers. Since the start of this year, Save America has spent $8.5 million on legal bills, and the Trump campaign has spent $1.8 million on such costs.\n\nTrump has used the charges against him as a rallying cry to galvanize his supporters \u2014 accusing Democrats and President Biden of weaponizing the powers of the Justice Department against him. (Biden has said that he has not suggested to the Justice Department what it should or should not do regarding charges.) Trump has structured his fundraising effort to benefit from his claims. Each time a donor contributes a dollar to the campaign through his joint fundraising committee, 10 cents is directed to Save America and 90 cents is allocated to the Trump presidential campaign.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign brought in nearly $11 million in February and had $33.5 million in cash on hand at the end of the month. Almost all of the money that Trump\u2019s campaign brought in during February came in the form of a transfer from a joint fundraising committee, campaign finance records show. Both Biden and Trump rely on a constellation of committees that together can raise and spend money on behalf of their candidacies.\n\nThough Biden has trailed Trump in many of the early national and battleground state polls, the incumbent\u2019s campaign and allied groups are outpacing Trump\u2019s effort in fundraising and the cash stockpiled for the general election. The disparity is fueled in part by the fact that Biden did not face a contested primary and has been able to raise money in conjunction with the Democratic National Committee, as well as state parties.\n\nThe Biden campaign said that it ended February with $155 million in the bank and that it raised money from nearly half a million donors. The team also said it raised $53 million in February across all of the five entities that are fundraising for the president\u2019s effort, including the DNC. It did not release a breakdown of how much each committee had raised, and some of those reports will not be available until April.\n\nWith flush coffers, the Biden team launched a $30 million spring advertising campaign in key swing states \u2014 including an ad aimed at Latino voters. The campaign has said it will open more than 100 offices this month, and Biden launched a national organizing program to engage Hispanic voters in Arizona this week.\n\nThe Trump campaign just recently joined forces with the Republican National Committee, which has faced its own fundraising strains, and began integrating their fundraising teams and other staff to create greater efficiencies. The campaign negotiated the terms of a joint fundraising agreement with the RNC and state parties across the country, which will help accelerate fundraising for the GOP effort.\n\nAs Trump continues to dominate the GOP landscape in drawing small donors, the RNC\u2019s fundraising has trailed the DNC\u2019s \u2014 though allies of the Trump campaign insist that their fundraising will pick up now that the campaign and the RNC are merging their efforts.\n\nOn Wednesday, the RNC reported that it had raised $10.7 million in February and ended the month with $11.3 million in cash on hand. The DNC raised $16.6 million and reported more than double the cash on hand with $26.6 million in the bank at the end of the month.\n\nAfter Trump clinched the nomination earlier this month, his team began a swift revamp of the RNC\u2019s operations as Ronna McDaniel stepped down as the committee\u2019s chair and Michael Whatley took over.\n\nOne of Trump\u2019s top advisers, Chris LaCivita, is overseeing the integration of the two operations and addressing dissatisfaction in some sectors of the party about the RNC\u2019s financial situation. Many higher-level aides to the RNC have resigned or been fired in recent weeks and some lower-level staffers were asked to reapply for their jobs.\n\nDespite the upheaval, Whatley said in a memo to RNC members that he was confident that the merging of the two teams would ultimately result in a strong fundraising effort for the GOP. He argued that the recent joint fundraising agreement negotiated by the RNC and the campaign would ensure the party has \u201cthe necessary funds to win up and down the ballot.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur two teams will get President Trump\u2019s vision for America in front of as many people as possible, and we are working on merging our digital assets both from the campaign and RNC,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis merger will greatly expand our capacity and reach.\u201d\n\nDemocrats mocked the fundraising disparity between the two parties on Wednesday. \u201cIf Donald Trump put up these kinds of numbers on The Apprentice, he\u2019d fire himself,\u201d the Biden campaign\u2019s communications director, Michael Tyler, said in a statement.\n\nNews Related",

            "text": "The Biden administration announced on Wednesday new regulations on tailpipe emissions that could reshape the nation\u2019s transportation sector. The rule, which calls for a 56% reduction in fleetwide average carbon emissions by 2032, constitutes the strictest-ever limit on pollution from the nation\u2019s cars and light trucks.\n\n\u201cToday, we\u2019re setting new pollution standards for cars and trucks,\u201d Joe Biden said in a statement. \u201cUS workers will lead the world on autos making clean cars and trucks, each stamped \u2018Made in America.\u2019 You have my word.\u201d\n\nThe new standards come as part of the White House efforts to slash greenhouse gas emissions. Transportation is the largest source of planet-warming emissions in the US, and passenger cars and trucks account for the majority of that pollution.\n\nBy the time the rule is fully implemented in 2055, it will have cumulatively slashed more than 7bn tons of carbon dioxide emissions, senior administration officials told reporters on Tuesday. It will also tackle toxic pollution, they said, slashing fine particulate emissions by 95% and emissions of NOx and volatile organic compounds by 75%.\n\nBut the regulation has been weakened since it was first proposed last spring.\n\nThe final rule would result in the same endpoint \u2013 a 56% reduction in fleetwide average carbon emissions by 2032 from 2026 levels \u2013 but the year-over-year tightening of the pollution standards between 2027 and 2030 will happen at a more gradual pace.\n\nThe change aligns with asks from auto manufacturers and the United Auto Workers. UAW, which has long noted that EV jobs often pay less than traditional autoworker jobs, last year said the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) should revise its standards to increase stringency \u201cmore gradually\u201d in an effort to ensure they do not \u201cdisproportionately impact domestic union auto production\u201d.\n\nBut critics say the slower cuts will allow automakers to continue selling fossil fuel-powered vehicles longer and will produce more cumulative pollution.\n\n\u201cThis rule could\u2019ve been the biggest single step of any nation on climate, but the EPA caved to pressure from big auto, big oil and car dealers, and riddled the plan with loopholes big enough to drive a Ford F150 through,\u201d said Dan Becker, director of the safe climate transport campaign at the environmental advocacy group Center for Biological Diversity.\n\nThe rule is expected to boost to national electric vehicle sales, but it does not mandate the sale of any type of vehicle. Last spring, the EPA projected that electric vehicles would need to make up about two-thirds of car and light truck sales by 2032, up from less than one-tenth in 2023, to meet emissions reduction goals.\n\nIn a shift from the 2023 proposal, which did not mention plug-in hybrid vehicles, the EPA\u2019s final rule says manufacturers could achieve the same reduction if 56% of cars sold are fully electric and 13% are plug-in hybrids by 2032. The move comes after automakers criticized the earlier omission.\n\nThe EPA says the rule will save the nation $99bn a year, including $46bn in reduced fuel costs and nearly $16bn in auto repair and maintenance. The rule is also expected to prevent 2,500 premature deaths by 2055 thanks to cuts in pollution.\n\nSome environmental groups applauded the new limits.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Our US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Two GOP lawmakers are preparing a resolution aiming to kill the rule, E&E News reports. On the campaign trail, Donald Trump has said he would repeal Biden\u2019s \u201cinsane electric vehicle mandate\u201d on his first day in office.\n\nEV sales are accelerating. Last year, they were up by 54% compared with 2022, which was a 46% increase from 2021, according to Wards Auto Data.\n\n\u201cFrom plug-in hybrids to fuel cells to fully electric, drivers have more choices today,\u201d said Biden\u2019s national climate adviser, Ali Zaidi, in emailed statement. \u201cThis growth means jobs, and it means we are moving faster and faster to take on the climate crisis.\u201d",

And instead of jumping the gun, it can sometimes help to pause, take a deep breath, and reexamine things a few days later.\n\nJust last week, President Joe Biden reached out to farmers and the rural community when his administration released the \u201cBillion Ton Report,\u201d announcing increased biomass production. This move will triple overall generation, advance sustainable aviation fuel, help tackle the climate crisis, and encourage the agriculture industry. Energy Secretary Granholm said this plan will take advantage of winter oilseed crops, microalgae from ocean farming, corn grain/ethanol, and carbon dioxide generated at industrial plants.\n\nAnd earlier this month, President Biden delivered a strong and energetic \u201cState of the Union\u201d speech, detailing issues important to the nation and to us here in Virginia and Amelia County. He explained how his administration has focused on growing our economy, promoting jobs, and ensuring that school teachers do not pay higher tax rates than billionaires and Fortune 500 corporations.\n\nPresident Biden has also emphasized strengthening women\u2019s rights and protecting our environment. His actions have reduced air pollution, promoted more clean energy initiatives, and ensured that family farms can stay in the family. He has strengthened worker union rights, built more roads and bridges, and constructed state-of-theart electric vehicle charging stations and broadband connections here in Virginia.\n\nPresident Biden has displayed a clear command of the issues facing our nation, our state, and our county.\n\nSincerely,\n\nStuart V.

            "text": "James Comer Eyes 'Criminal Referrals' from Biden Probe\n\nBiden Impeachment Probe The ongoing Biden impeachment inquiry, spearheaded by the House Oversight Committee, has been thrust into the spotlight as Representative James Comer, a key figure in the process, has signaled an interest in pursuing potential criminal referrals. via NBC This development has ignited a fresh wave of scrutiny and debate, underscoring the complex dynamics at play within the inquiry and its broader implications. The prospect of criminal referrals has injected a new dimension of intensity into the contentious inquiry.\n\nBiden's Business Dealings via ABC The House Oversight Committee's investigation into Hunter Biden's business dealings could result in \"criminal referrals\" to the Department of Justice, according to Committee Chair James Comer.\n\nDiscrepancies via NBC \u201cI think that we\u2019re at the point in the investigation where we need to hear the discrepancies,\u201d Comer said. \u201cI fully expect Hunter Biden to show up. If he [Hunter] does not show up, then it\u2019s not going to end well for the Bidens, because we have three witnesses \u2026 that have already testified under oath to significantly different stories as to what exactly the Biden influence peddling schemes were,\u201d he said.\n\nEvidence of wrongdoing via NBC \u201cThis is very serious because we\u2019re at the point now of criminal referrals,\u201d Comer said. Comer and other Republicans like Gaetz, Issa, and Higgins have said the investigation has found evidence of wrongdoing and influence peddling by the Biden family, though the standards for impeachment are high.\n\nBiden legal team via NBC \u201cWe have spent a year investigating this. We have faced massive obstruction from the White House, from the Biden legal team, yet we have been able to get probably 80 percent of the information that we have requested,\u201d Comer said. \u201cWe have accumulated lots of evidence of wrongdoing. I can\u2019t tell you a single legitimate business the Bidens had, other than they were influence peddling,\u201d Comer added.\n\n\n\nBiden's Fate via NBC They maintain criminal referrals are a better option than impeachment, and that ultimately voters will decide Biden's fate in the 2024 election. Some Republicans argue this would be a symbolic move with little accountability, while others believe referrals could spur action if Republicans regain control of the DOJ after the 2024 election.\n\nPotential criminal referrals via NBC The House Oversight Committee's relentless pursuit of the impeachment inquiry against President Joe Biden has reached a critical juncture, with Rep. James Comer signaling a strategic shift towards exploring potential criminal referrals related to the Biden family's business dealings.\n\n'He deserves them' via CBS \u201cHe [Joe Biden] deserves them,\u201d Rep. Matt Gaetz said of the criminal referrals. \u201cI don\u2019t think that a sufficient number of Republicans hold the view I do that a bribe can be consummated through a payment to a family member,\u201d Gaetz added. \u201cThe D.O.J. is about to change hands \u2026 It\u2019s about to be under new management.\u201d\n\nMake a decision via NBC \u201cIf our investigation reveals that impeachment is not a righteous pursuit, perhaps a criminal referral is,\u201d Rep. Clay Higgins said. \u201cIt\u2019s a much heavier lift for impeachment,\u201d he added. \u201cSo I would say that no matter what the Oversight Committee does, the American people are going to have an opportunity in November to make a decision.\u201d\n\nRefused to testify via ABC Hunter Biden has refused to testify publicly after initially agreeing to do so. The absence of Hunter Biden, the panel's star witness, from a public hearing, despite his prior private testimony, has set the stage for Rep. Comer's assertion that \"it's not going to end well for the Bidens.\" This statement, coupled with the indication of \"multiple criminal referrals,\" has underscored the escalating stakes and the potential ramifications of the inquiry's trajectory.\n\nLeveraged their family via NBC The committee's narrative revolves around assertions that the Bidens leveraged their family name for influence-peddling, alleging a web of connections and interactions that seek to implicate Joe Biden in his son's business dealings. The focus on alleged discrepancies and influence-peddling has laid the groundwork for the potential pursuit of criminal referrals within the inquiry.\n\nDivergent reactions via CBS As the inquiry navigates the political landscape, the prospect of criminal referrals has elicited divergent reactions, with implications resonating beyond the confines of the committee's proceedings. The delicate balance of political pressure, public perception, and the intricacies of the impeachment inquiry has fueled a narrative of heightened significance and far-reaching implications.\n\nEscalating tensions via NBC Amid the escalating tensions and the potential trajectory of the inquiry, unresolved questions linger about the specific nature of the potential criminal referrals, the individuals who may be targeted, and the possible offenses under scrutiny. The evolving dynamics of the inquiry and the looming specter of criminal referrals have left the political landscape in a state of anticipation and speculation.\n\nComer's indication via NBC Rep. James Comer's indication of possible 'criminal referrals' from the Biden impeachment inquiry has injected a new layer of complexity and intensity into the proceedings.",

            "text": "'A PRETTY CONSISTENT ASSESSMENT': Former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mark Milley, now retired, insisted he wasn't making big news Tuesday when he told the House Foreign Affairs Committee that just about everyone among the senior leadership at the Pentagon recommended President Joe Biden leave at least 2,500 U.S. troops in Afghanistan to keep the Taliban from taking over.\n\nMilley said the opinion was \"a pretty consistent assessment\" by him and other members of the uniformed military up to and including the secretary of defense. \"My analysis based on my assessment and the recommendations of the commanders, to include Gen. [Frank] McKenzie and the consensus of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was that we needed to maintain a minimum force of 2,500 troops on the ground, mostly special forces, with allied troops and contractors, in order to sustain the Afghan National Security Forces and its government until the diplomatic conditions of the Doha Agreement were met,\" Milley testified, noting he's made similar statements in previous congressional testimony. \"Without this support, it was my view at the time that it was only a matter of when, not if, the Afghan government would collapse and the Taliban would take control.\"\n\nBut the fact that Milley said so plainly that recommendation against withdrawal was the clear consensus of the Pentagon caught the ear of former Defense Secretary Mark Esper, who was fired by then-President Donald Trump shortly after the 2020 election in part for opposing Trump's plan to pull all U.S. troops out of Afghanistan before he left office.\n\n\"Both he and Gen. McKenzie said that they, to include Secretary [of] Defense Lloyd Austin, had recommended to the president that 2,500 troops be at that remaining country,\" Esper, who is now CNN's global affairs analyst, said Wednesday. \"And of course we know President Biden said later to George Stephanopoulos on ABC, that\u2019s not the case \u2014 that he wasn\u2019t told that.\"\n\nFORMER TOP GENERALS DECRY FATAL MISTAKES IN BIDEN'S DISASTROUS 2021 AFGHANISTAN WITHDRAWAL ORDER\n\nBIDEN IN 2021: 'NO ONE SAID THAT TO ME THAT I CAN RECALL': In that Aug. 18, 2021, ABC interview, Stephanopoulos grilled Biden repeatedly about whether he was acting against the advice of his top military commanders. Here's part of the exchange:\n\nStephanopoulos: Your top military advisers warned against withdrawing on this timeline. They wanted you to keep about 2,500 troops.\n\nBiden: No, they didn\u2019t. It was split. That wasn\u2019t true. That wasn\u2019t true.\n\nStephanopoulos: They didn\u2019t tell you that they wanted troops to stay?\n\nBiden: No. Not at \u2014 not in terms of whether we were going to get out in a time frame all troops. They didn\u2019t argue against that.\n\nStephanopoulos: So no one told \u2014 your military advisers did not tell you, \u201cNo, we should just keep 2,500 troops. It\u2019s been a stable situation for the last several years. We can do that. We can continue to do that\u201d?\n\nBiden: No. No one said that to me that I can recall.\n\nA few minutes later:\n\nStephanopoulos: So would you have withdrawn troops like this even if President Trump had not made that deal with the Taliban?\n\nBiden: I would\u2019ve tried to figure out how to withdraw those troops, yes, because look, George, there is no good time to leave Afghanistan.\n\nAL QAEDA AND ISIS RECONSTITUTING: The testimony from Milley and retired Marine Gen. Frank McKenzie, former commander of the U.S. Central Command, has reopened old wounds among Afghanistan veterans who feel betrayed by the withdrawal after 20 years of blood and treasure, especially after the new CENTCOM commander, Army Gen. Michael \"Erik\" Kurilla, testified just yesterday that the Islamic State and al Qaeda are making a comeback.\n\n\"I would tell you that we do see the Taliban is harboring al Qaeda,\" Kurilla told the House Armed Services Committee Thursday. \"The risk of an attack emanating from Afghanistan is increasing. I assess ISIS-Khorasan retains the capability and the will to attack U.S. and Western interests abroad in as little as six months, with little to no warning.\"\n\n\"I\u2019m talking to veterans. They are really, really upset and feel a sense of betrayal by the way this went down,\" retired Lt. Col. Scott Mann said on CNN. Mann, a former Green Beret, is the author of the book Operation Pineapple Express, which details the efforts of a group of Green Berets to save the lives of comrades and Afghans during the chaotic 2021 withdrawal from Kabul.\n\n\"I think I\u2019m speaking for a lot of veterans that when I watched that testimony, these two general officers who both said they knew this was coming, they knew this was going to happen,\" Mann told CNN's Jake Tapper. \"The question that so many veterans have on their minds is why did a flag officer not throw his or her stars on the table and take a stand against this, particularly seeing the way that ISIS-K and al Qaeda are now reemerging in a place where 9/11 originated from?

While we're away, you can still find breaking defense news on the Washington Examiner's national security and defense page.\n\nHAPPENING TODAY: CRUNCH TIME FOR THE BUDGET: House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) is predicting passage of the $1.2 trillion \"minibus\" spending bill that will fund the rest of the federal government for the rest of this fiscal year, but it may cost him his job.\n\n\"It will pass. We're whipping the bill, and I expect a good number,\" Johnson said, after agreeing to expedite the vote on the budget bill under a process that requires a two-thirds majority for passage.\n\nThe compromise measure, meant to avert a shutdown at midnight and resolve the long-simmering dispute over the federal budget, has the hard-right House Freedom Caucus hopping mad and talking about finding a new \"more effective\" speaker.\n\n\"No @HouseGOP should vote for the #SwampOmnibus with these earmarks,\" the caucus posted on social media. \"A massive spending bill drafted in secrecy and dropped on us in the middle of the night is being rushed to the House floor for a vote with less than 36 hours to review.\"\n\nWhile lawmakers will likely miss the midnight deadline, requiring a weekend Senate session, Sen. Mike Rounds (R-SD) said on CNN, \"And so, there may be a shutdown over the weekend. I don\u2019t like that idea. I think this is a terrible way to run a government.\"\n\n\"This was supposed to be done last October. And so here we are. We\u2019re still working on last year\u2019s appropriation bills while we\u2019re trying to start on this year\u2019s appropriation bills that are supposed to be done in October,\" Rounds said. \"It\u2019s a terrible thing to do.'\n\n\"It is a significant bill. It\u2019s about $1.19 trillion, or 70% of our total overall annual budget,\" Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE) said on Fox News. \"That\u2019s because the Department of Defense is one of the six bills that\u2019s up for us to pass. I think we have to avoid a government shutdown at all costs. It sends a terrible signal globally for us to shut down the federal government.\"\n\n\"I also think the House should take up and pass the supplemental that will fund Ukraine, fund Israel, and fund humanitarian aid. My hope is that Speaker Johnson will put that on the floor just after we clear these annual appropriations bills,\" Coons said. \"I continue to think that the best step for us to take is to take up and pass the bipartisan bill that was negotiated at great length here by Republican Sen. [James] Lankford and Democratic Sen. [Chris] Murphy with Sen. [Kyrsten] Sinema.\"\n\nREPUBLICAN TONY GONZALES BALKS AT BIPARTISAN FUNDING BILL: 'COUNT ME OUT'\n\nBLINKEN IN ISRAEL: Secretary of State Antony Blinken is in Israel today meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wartime Cabinet as Netanyahu seems determined to ground assault on the southern Gaza city of Rafah, over U.S. objections.\n\n\"There are more than a million people in Rafah, many of whom were displaced from other parts of Gaza. A major ground operation there would mean more civilian deaths. It would worsen the humanitarian crisis. There is a better way to deal with the threat \u2014 the ongoing threat posed by Hamas,\" Blinken said during a stop in Egypt yesterday.\n\nBlinken cited a U.S.-sponsored resolution declaring \"the imperative of an immediate and sustained ceasefire,\" set for a vote today in the United Nations Security Council, and expressed hope that negotiations in Doha between the United States, Egypt, and Qatar might soon bear fruit.\n\n\"Negotiators continue to work, the gaps are narrowing, and we're continuing to push for an agreement in Doha,\" Blinken said. \"There's still difficult work to get there, but I continue to believe it's possible.\"\n\nUS AND ISRAEL HEADED FOR 'BREACH' OVER LAST HAMAS BATTLE: 'NOT GOING TO STOP US'\n\nUKRAINE BOMBARDED, AGAIN: Overnight, Ukraine was hit by another massive attack by Russian missiles and drones, targeting the capital Kyiv for the first time in six weeks. \"Falling wreckage still damaged apartment buildings and injured 13 people, including a child,\" the Associated Press reported, citing local officials.\n\nUkraine claimed its air defenses shot down all 31 of the missiles that were targeting Kyiv and shot down 92 of the 151 Russian \"aerial targets,\" including 55 drones and 35 cruise missiles. \"Ukraine needs more air defense!\" the Ukraine Defense Ministry posted on its social media page.\n\n\"Patriots and other systems are now needed in Ukraine for our cities and communities,\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his nightly video address. \"With all our partners, we are always talking about increasing our ability to defend the sky. The partners have the air defense systems that are needed for this, and they can help. It is worth doing so. It is worth protecting lives.\"\n\n\"On the other hand, every Russian terrorist attack shows that the world\u2019s sanctions against Putin\u2019s system are not yet sufficient. Every Russian missile used by these savages to attack our country contains components manufactured by companies from other countries \u2014 not from Russia,\" Zelensky said. \"There are at least 53 types of such components in the design of the X-101 missiles. The Kinzhal missile has at least 49 types of components that Russia does not produce.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nTHE RUNDOWN:\n\nWashington Examiner: 'Global implications': Military leaders warn of growing China-Russia-Iran alliance\n\nWashington Examiner: Former top generals decry fatal mistakes in Biden's disastrous 2021 Afghanistan withdrawal order\n\nWashington Examiner: US submits resolution to UN for immediate ceasefire in Gaza that secures release of hostages\n\nWashington Examiner: US and Israel headed for 'breach' over last Hamas battle: 'Not going to stop us'\n\nWashington Examiner: Israel's renewed battle at Shifa Hospital emblematic of difficulty wiping out Hamas\n\nWashington Examiner: More than 10% of buildings in Gaza have been destroyed in war: UN\n\nWashington Examiner: New transcript describes Trump's chilling response to chaos that unfolded on Jan. 6\n\nWashington Examiner: Fani Willis pushing for summer Trump trial even as her fate on case hangs in balance: Report\n\nWashington Examiner: Video shows illegal immigrants storming US border wall\n\nWashington Examiner: Johnson's reliance on minority gives Democrats confidence they're headed for victory in November\n\nWashington Examiner: Republican Tony Gonzales balks at bipartisan funding bill: 'Count me out'\n\nWashington Examiner: GOP blasts funding increase for impeached Mayorkas tucked in spending deal\n\nWashington Examiner: Opinion: Biden must revitalize the nuclear arsenal\n\nWashington Examiner: Opinion: The TikTok bill proves Congress can get serious about national security\n\nWashington Examiner: Opinion: Christine Wormuth's cuts to the Army's warfighting capabilities are wrong\n\nWashington Examiner: Speaker Mike Johnson's fake fiscal conservatism\n\nWall Street Journal: Russians Are Growing Tired of War\n\nWall Street Journal: Robots Are Entering The Ukraine Battlefield\n\nWashington Post: Nervous Europe Explores Using Russian Assets To Aid Ukraine\n\nMilitary.com: Money for 5.2 Percent Troop Pay Raise, Enlisted Hardship Bonuses Included in Last-Minute Government Funding Bill\n\nDefense News: U.S. Navy Making Aegis Updates, Training Changes Based On Houthi Attacks\n\nBloomberg: Yemen's Houthis Tell China, Russia Their Ships Won't Be Targeted\n\nReuters: Red Sea Fighting Traps Two Oil Ships In Houthi Waters\n\nReuters: Somali Pirates Return, Adding To Global Shipping Crisis\n\nBreaking Defense: It's Official: The F-35 Will Not Get a New Engine anytime soon\n\nDefense News: F-35 Delivery Delays Frustrate European Air Force Upgrade Plans\n\nAir & Space Forces Magazine: 'Flying IEDs': Combatant Commanders Tell Congress Small Drones Are a Big Problem\n\nThe War Zone: XQ-58 Valkyrie Drone Family Has Grown to Five Variants\n\nAir & Space Forces Magazine: Space Force Wants IOC for Tactically Responsive Space in 2025\n\nSpaceNews: US Military to Boost Surveillance Assets in Orbit\n\nDefenseScoop: Michael Sulmeyer Tapped for New Top Pentagon Cyber Policy Role\n\nAir & Space Forces Magazine: One General's Quest to Vibe Check Air Force Culture\n\nWashington Post: Intel Analyst Shared Classified Information on Discord, Investigators Say\n\nStars and Stripes: Air Force 2-star pleads not guilty to sexual assault\n\nAir & Space Forces Magazine: INDOPACOM Boss on China: 'Haven't Faced a Threat Like This Since World War II'\n\nTask & Purpose: Families at Edwards Air Force Base Living in RVs for Housing Relief\n\nMilitary.com: Medical Care Shortfalls for US Personnel in Japan Trigger Push from Lawmakers for Improvements\n\nAP: Ghost Army members who deceived Nazis with battlefield ruses in WWII given Congressional Gold Medal\n\nWashington Post: Alfred M.

Trump called the ruling \"weaponization against a political opponent.\"\n\nTrump's learning payback's a ...\n\nI had to Google \"petard\" to find out what one is but it sure seems as if Donald Trump has just been hoisted by his. Reports are that he cannot secure a bond to cover his civil fraud penalties because underwriters won't accept real estate as collateral and he was turned down by more than 30 companies. I guess that after decades of evaluating his properties depending on which fraud suited his needs no one now is willing to accept his real estate as collateral. The fact that bonds cover penalties resulting from fraudulent valuations makes it even more ironic.\n\nMichael Kirshner, West Palm Beach\n\nMore: Could Trump get a third term as President? We have that answer for you. | Opinion\n\nLife would be better under Trump\n\nA reader writes that Donald Trump and Trump Republicans don't want to support Ukraine, the Middle East and the southern border, and he is correct because none of those things would have occurred under Trump's watch. When terrorism reared its ugly head, Trump took out [Iranian Major General] Qasem Soleimani. Under Trump, Vladimir Putin would not be in Ukraine, Houthi rebels would not be attacking ships in the Red Sea. The border would not be wide open, and Hamas would not be attacking Israel. So yes, Trump Republicans are very reluctant to pay for President Biden's mistakes.\n\nJim Rich, Jupiter\n\nDeal reveals 'Don't say gay' hyperbole\n\nRe the March 13 story, \"A settlement has been reached after litigation over Florida's critic-called 'Don't Say Gay' Law,\" and both sides are claiming victory\": Talk about irony. The result is that the law remains as written but the ruling is that the law does not prevent classroom discussion and references to LGBTQ people and associated issues. In other words, after all the disingenuous hoopla, the ruling is that the law doesn't say or imply that teachers are required to \"Don't Say Gay.\" If critics had actually taken the time to read the law in the first place, all the lawsuits and rhetorical hyperbole could have been avoided.\n\nGeorge Bieberbach, North Palm Beach\n\nPatience toward Israeli war wearing thin\n\nThe path being charted by [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu and his extreme right-wing government is dangerous. Israel continues to reject the two-state solution and insists on controlling the government of its neighbors, by force if need be. How is this any different from the war in Ukraine where Russia wants to control its neighbors? Israel was well aware of the neighborhood when it was given statehood in 1948 when Israel soon began driving out Palestinians from their land. Most were driven into Gaza. Israel needs to accept some responsibility for this Middle East quagmire. The two-state solution proposed by the U.S. appears to be the only way forward for all sides. It\u2019s time for Israel to find a way into that path. The patience of [President Joe] Biden and the American people is growing thin.\n\nBob O\u2019Donnell, Jupiter\n\nThe Palm Beach Post is committed to publishing a diversity of opinions.

But Trump is not ruined yet, and he\u2019s also the frontrunner for President in November\u2019s election.\n\n\u201cEven though I did nothing wrong, a Radical Left New York Judge, a true Trump Hater, Arthur Engoron (Are we allowed to speak about his Unconstitutional Gag Order?), picked a number out of THIN AIR, $355,000,000, plus interest (reminiscent of John Lovitz, \u201cThe Liar,\u201d on SNL when it was good), & wants me to bond it, which is not possible for bonding companies to do in such a high amount, before I can even Appeal. That is CRAZY!,\u201d President Trump stated on his social media platform Truth Social.\n\n\u201cIf I sold assets, and then won the Appeal, the assets would be forever gone. Also, putting up money before an Appeal is VERY EXPENSIVE. When I win the Appeal, all of that money is gone, and I would have done nothing wrong. The Crooked Judge, who has already been overturned 4 times on this case (a record!), fully understands this. He gave us a demand which he knows is impossible to do. This Witch Hunt, between a bad Judge and a Corrupt & Racist Attorney General, is horrible for New York. Businesses are FLEEING, while Violent Crime flourishes. ELECTION INTERFERENCE!,\u201d President Trump said.\n\nThis is not the first time that Trump mentioned Lovitz. Previously, Trump referred to Lovit\u2019z \u201cLiar\u201d character in a debate with Hillary Clinton, which Lovitz muses upon in his standup act. President Trump delivered arguably the greatest SNL hosting performance of all time during his first campaign, when he danced to Drake\u2019s \u201cHotline Bling.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Judge Engoron has showbiz ambitions of his own.\n\nNational File reported:\n\nArthur Engoron, the Democrat judge who sentenced President Donald Trump to pay more than $300 million in a civil litigation judgment in New York, wrote a Holocaust screenplay called \u201cViktor Glaser\u2019s Holocaust,\u201d which refers to \u201cGoyim\u201d (a disparaging name for gentiles) and the Talmud religious book. The script is downright terrible, according to excerpts published on a WordPress site. Engoron has been actively trying to sell the screenplay to Hollywood in recent years, according to posts that he made in his alumni association newsletter. NATIONAL FILE presents to you some of the worst passages from Democrat judge Arthur Engoron\u2019s awful Holocaust screenplay, which he wrote with Tom Glaser and Jill Glaser:\n\n\u201cDAISY\n\nGood evening, Mr. Glaser, I\u2019m sorry for intruding.\n\nVIKTOR\n\nNot at all!

If you are my fate, I will laugh hard.\n\nDAISY\n\nAnd if you are my fate, I hope my parents will understand.\n\nScene 7\n\nIRWIN\n\nYou\u2019re not mature enough for love OR marriage.\n\nDAISY\n\nYou think that because to you I am still your little girl. But I am a woman now, with the feelings that women feel, like love, and I love Viktor.\n\nIRWIN\n\nWell, I hope you know what you are doing, because we certainly don\u2019t.\n\nScene 8\n\nVIKTOR\n\nMother, Father, I have some good news and some not-so-good news.\n\nLUDMILA\n\nTell us the good news first, there\u2019s enough bad news in the air\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 AND the press.\n\nVIKTOR\n\nThe good news is that I\u2019m getting married.\n\nLUDMILA\n\nZIGMUND, PINCH ME.

We hope, and believe, that it is worthy of being made into a \u201cMajor Motion Picture.\u201d Does anybody know, or know of, an agent that could work with us and pitch this to Hollywood?

The following link will take you to a video presentation he gave as part of the first annual Vermont Holocaust Education Week, which is addressed to students and anyone else who might be interested\u2026The Video takes about 20 seconds to commence; the only thing you have to do is be patient. Tom and his classmate-wife Jill Glaser and I have collaborated on a screenplay based on those experiences. If you would like a copy of it just let me know. We are working on having it turned into a movie; please let me know if you can help us do so (as some of you already have, although we still have a ways to go). Art Engoron (1967)\u201d\n\nThe Wheatley School Alumni Association Newsletter featured a writing from by Arthur Engoron on March 2, 2023: \u201cAn aging population has become more nostalgic and has more time on its hands to compose and send memories\u2026And not to get too personal, but I have a gym to go to, a dog to walk, a commute to navigate, four children, an inordinately active social life, and a day job of which some of you may be aware. But lately, the main competitor for \u201cWheatley Time\u201d is my Holocaust screenplay, Viktor Glaser\u2019s Holocaust, which needs more tender love and care than a vegetable garden in Maine, as I try to improve, and contemporaneously try to sell, it.\u201d\n\nEngoron wrote in the August 1, 2023 in The Wheatley School Alumni Association Newsletter: \u201cI plan not to publish at all in August (and this time I mean it!). Instead, I am going to go all-out on having my screenplay, Viktor Glaser\u2019s Holocaust, made into a Major Motion Picture. I haven\u2019t seen Barbie or Oppenheimer, but they have some serious competition coming down the \u2018pike. Feel free to submit material, but don\u2019t expect to see it published until September. And let me know if you want a link to the screenplay, which is on-line.\u201d",

Regan.\n\n\u201cThe rules will reduce more than 7 billion tons of climate pollution, enhance the quality of the air in overburdened communities, and provide drivers with more affordable, environmentally friendly car options. Regan asserted, \u201cUnder President Biden\u2019s direction, our Administration is combining unprecedented investments with strict regulations to boost American manufacturing, fortify domestic supply networks, and generate well-paying employment.\u201d\n\nThe EPA\u2019s pollution reduction objectives will be unaffected, he told reporters.\n\nAccording to the New York Post, Regan said, \u201cLet me be clear: Our final rule offers the same, if not greater, pollution reduction that we put forth in our proposal.\u201d \u201cPeople, these new guidelines are crucial for the environment, American employment, public health, and our economy.\u201d\n\nRepublicans claim that by requiring American customers to switch from gas-powered automobiles, the new requirements will artificially raise demand for electric vehicles, branding them as an \u201cEV mandate.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know, maybe some would want for it to be an EV requirement, but that obviously is not the case when you look at the numerous avenues firms may take to comply,\u201d Regan said in response to his criticism.\n\n\u201cBy not requiring a specific technology, we are remaining fully within the bounds of the law and our legislative power,\u201d he asserted.\n\nPresident Biden\u2019s National Climate Advisor, Ali Zaidi, praised the president for his support of unions and for \u201cinvesting in America\u201d and the middle class. Biden\u2019s \u201cplan is working,\u201d according to Zaidi, to provide Americans with more options when it comes to cars.\n\nIn an effort to encourage drivers to convert to hybrid and electric cars, the rules specifically target gas-powered automobiles. By 2032, officials anticipate that the rules will guarantee that over 56% of newly marketed automobiles will be electric.\n\nThe Alliance for Consumers\u2019 executive director, O.H. Skinner, stated to the Daily Caller News Foundation that the Biden administration is \u201cdoubling down\u201d on its push to \u201cforcibly remove most cars that everyday consumers currently use.\u201d Based on these new emission standards, Skinner said.\n\nSkinner refuted the administration\u2019s assertion that Americans would save money by switching to electric vehicles.\n\n\u201cA transition to electric vehicles along the lines the EPA has announced will make things worse for everyday Americans while costing them more for having their lives inconvenienced,\u201d Skinner told DCNF, \u201ceven though an extreme EV mandate might be popular in progressive enclaves and with federal employees who live in Washington, D.C.\u201d\n\nBlaze News previously reported that the Biden administration announced an energy grid proposal last week for long-haul freight vehicles fueled by hydrogen and electricity. Installing charging and refueling stations along 12,000 miles of busy routes is the goal of the 16-year infrastructure plan.",

He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life in prison.\n\nThe building where the shooting took place is scheduled to be demolished this year. It has remained largely unaltered since the 2018 shooting, with bloodstains and bullet holes still visible.\n\nSome advocates regard the red flag laws as violating their constitutional right to bear arms, while gun safety advocates point to some studies showing they can prevent some deaths.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has made gun violence a key issue in his 2024 reelection bid and tapped Harris, a former prosecutor, to oversee the effort. Both have traveled across the country to meet with people whose families died in mass shootings.\n\nThe United States has the highest level of firearm homicides among high-income countries with populations over 10 million, according to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington School of Medicine.\n\nBiden, a Democrat, wants Congress to approve a new assault weapons ban and to require background checks for all U.S. gun sales. Each measure will be difficult to pass in a divided Congress. Republican candidate Donald Trump has previously supported red flag laws but opposed broader measures favored by Biden.\n\n(Reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt.

His administration\u2019s inaction on high-interest rates and the rising cost of living have made it difficult for working-class families to own a home. And yet, he has the audacity to blame President Trump for these issues.\n\nIn a desperate attempt to win over voters, Biden promised a $10,000 mortgage relief tax credit and a $10,000 tax credit for those selling their homes. But how does he plan to fund these handouts?\n\nOf course, Biden will increase taxes on hardworking Americans. It\u2019s obvious his solution to every problem is to throw more money at it rather than implement sound economic policies that have proven successful under President Trump.\n\nBiden also called on real estate brokerages to \u201clower commissions,\u201d conveniently ignoring that the National Association of Realtors agreed to resolve an antitrust lawsuit just last week.\n\nIn Arizona, Biden spoke at a Mexican restaurant in a blatant attempt to appeal to Latino voters. He knows that he needs their support if he wants to win battleground states, but his charm offensive can\u2019t hide the fact that he flip-flopped on key issues, such as immigration and trade, to pander to his base.\n\nBiden is panicking as Trump\u2019s approval ratings continue to rise. It seems many on both sides of the fence are not happy with Biden. Some left-wing voters have even launched an \u201cAbandon Biden\u201d movement, urging voters to support an obscure author in the Democratic primary.",

            "text": "Last year, German health minister Karl Lauterbach did something politicians almost never do unless they\u2019ve been caught with their pants down: He apologized. Closing schools for long periods during the COVID-19 pandemic, Lauterbach said, had been an \u201cunnecessary mistake.\u201d\n\nWhere is our Lauterbach?\n\nThough President Joe Biden wasn\u2019t in office at the start of the pandemic, he and other prominent Democrats have had ample opportunities to account for their roles in a slow-motion disaster that began almost exactly four years ago, when schools closed \u201ctemporarily\u201d in the earliest days of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nAfter what was supposed to be a merely temporary closure, New York City announced on March 23, 2020, that it was moving to remote learning for the rest of the year. That day, remote learning \u201cofficially\u201d began in Washington, D.C., too, after days of haphazard experimentation with digital education. Similar experiments emerged across the country, as parents realized\u2014with dread, in many cases\u2014that the societal disruption of the coronavirus was going to last.\n\nFour years later, the wounds have not fully healed.\n\nTrue, Republican resistance to masks and vaccines harmed and killed many more people than any policy embraced by liberals. But I don\u2019t think I am alone in expecting greater moral clarity from Biden than from Donald Trump. And when it comes to school, it is clear that Democrats have not truly reckoned with the decisions they made in 2020 and 2021.\n\nEarlier this week, a data analysis by The New York Times summarized the effect of the closures that began four years ago: \u201c\u2026extended school closures did not significantly stop the spread of COVID, while the academic harms for children have been large and long-lasting.\u201d The longer schools stayed closed (or partly closed, with students only attending school in-person one or two days per week), the more children fell behind.\n\nThe devastating effects of remote learning are evident today in the absenteeism crisis, the teacher shortage, and the spike in mental illness among young adults.\n\nThis week, The Times also reported that city schools \u201care grappling with a spike in discipline problems among children, evidence that the disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic are having lingering effects, educators and experts say.\u201d It\u2019s not just about test scores. Our children lost something essential because adults lacked the courage to do the right thing.\n\nThus, the deep bitterness many parents felt about having to play \u201cteacher\u201d for months on end. That bitterness manifested in the suburbs of Northern Virginia in Nov. 2021, helping Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, become the state\u2019s next governor. And it is still there, waiting to surface in Nov. 2024.\n\n\u201cI think parents who saw their children suffer from politics rather than scientific principles in making policy decisions still think about the prolonged school closures in the U.S.,\u201d Monica Gandhi, a professor of medicine at the University of California at San Francisco who bravely called for schools to reopen long before many of her peers, wrote to me in an email.\n\nGrievances tend to work on voters more than promises, I have found. The grievances of parents\u2014mothers in suburban swing districts, for instance\u2014could hurt Biden much the way they did former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, the president\u2019s friend, when he ran confidently against the inexperienced Youngkin.\n\nIt should have never come to this. By summer 2020, we knew that children, for the most part, don\u2019t get especially sick with COVID-19. And around that time we also knew that schools were never the viral incubators some claimed they were bound to become. Studies from South Korea, the United Kingdom, and other countries confirmed as much. So did the safe reopening of schools in red states like Florida and Texas.\n\nSomehow, evidence did not seem to matter. People who claimed to \u201clisten to the science\u201d turned away when the science said schools should reopen.\n\n\u201cLiberals really poisoned the well when they decided to wage war against anyone who dared to make any public health calculations during the pandemic, despite the fact that such calculations were inevitable and necessary,\u201d wrote the perceptive writer Freddie deBoer in a recent Substack newsletter. \u201cThe relentless braying about \u2018eugenics,\u2019 the insistence that anyone who was not a [non-pharmaceutical intervention] maximalist hated the disabled and wanted them to die, contributed directly to the backlash that has resulted in so much COVID conspiracy insanity.\u201d\n\nIf Govs. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) and Greg Abbott (R-TX) were reopening schools, then reopening schools had to be wrong, because DeSantis and Abbott did not trust the science and were xenophobic bigots to boot\u2014so the righteous thinking went at the time. To oppose them was to oppose everything wrong with America under Trump. So the schools stayed closed in most deep blue municipalities.\n\nIn a harrowing article for The New Yorker published in fall 2020, reporter Alec MacGillis bracingly revealed the scope of devastation remote learning brought to poor kids, especially poor kids of color.\n\nMost chilling of all was the transparently disingenuous defense of school closures by Becky Pringle, head of the powerful National Education Association (NEA), of which First Lady Jill Biden is a member. Pringle preposterously told MacGillis that if schools reopened, some 50,000 children would die. But no news outlet fact-checked her. No one accused Pringle of peddling misinformation, the way they would have if a conservative had made so flagrantly baseless an assertion.\n\n\u201c Somehow, evidence did not seem to matter. People who claimed to \u2018listen to the science\u2019 turned away when the science said schools should reopen. \u201d\n\nAmazingly, some union leaders continue to defend having closed down schools for months on end. \u201cI do believe it was the right decision,\u201d Jerry Jordan of the Philadelphia Federation of Teachers told The Times this week. It is a defiant statement, and an indefensible one. And unless Democrats renounce it, they own it.\n\nIt is true that we did not know how serious the virus was at first, which justified closing schools and businesses. But a state of permanent emergency was unsustainable; once we learned how the virus behaved, we should have adjusted accordingly. Yet some \u201cexperts\u201d continued to insist on masking outside and keeping schools closed.\n\nFour years ago, we were lost in the \u201cfog of war.\u201d The fog was thick at first, but by May it did begin to lift. We started to understand the true threat of the virus, whom it harmed and for whom it was a very minor risk. Yet in many highly-populated jurisdictions governed by Democrats, nothing changed. It was almost as if they longed for the fog to stay.\n\nNow, there ought to be some honest accountability. We don\u2019t need blue ribbon commissions or Capitol Hill hearings to relitigate how we responded to the pandemic. But we do need elected leaders to have the decency to admit their own mistakes.\n\n\u201cThe Buck Stops Here,\u201d said the famous sign on President Harry Truman\u2019s desk.\n\nWhere does the buck stop in 2024? Nobody owns their decisions or owns up to their mistakes. There is an almost Soviet avoidance of responsibility. This sure is awful, but it\u2019s not my fault. That guy over there, he looks guilty. Off to the gulag!\n\nIf you ask the White House, they will tell you that Biden quickly got schools open in 2021. That\u2019s true. Kind of.\n\nBut it took billions of federal stimulus dollars, and in many districts, unsatisfactory hybrid learning continued. Then, when the Delta variant came along in late 2021, many schools closed again\u2014with an especially protracted refusal to return to the classroom by the teachers of Chicago, where in several months Democrats will hold their national convention.\n\n\u201cI think an apology and acknowledgement of the mistakes Democrats made in this epidemic towards children would go a long way in helping their constituents forgive,\u201d Dr. Gandhi wrote to me.\n\nThere were plenty of things that Democrats got right about the pandemic. But nobody, anywhere, got it completely right. Not China, not California, not Florida, not Sweden. We know that now. Our political leaders should be brave enough to say it.",

            "text": "Mike Pence in Washington DC on 26 May 2020; Donald Trump in Des Moines, Iowa, on 10 January 2024. Photograph: Brendan Smialowskikamil Krzaczynski/AFP/Getty Images\n\nDonald Trump told his vice-president, Mike Pence, that refusing to block certification of Joe Biden\u2019s 2021 election victory at the Capitol on 6 January 2021 would be \u201ca political career killer\u201d, according to newly released testimony from a presidential valet.\n\n\u201cMike, this is a political career killer if you do this,\u201d Trump told Pence by phone on the morning of January 6, the New York Times reported, citing a transcript of testimony to the House committee that investigated the deadly attack on Congress that unfolded later that day.\n\nAccording to the Times, the unnamed valet also said Trump appeared unconcerned when he was told a civilian had been shot dead as the Capitol was stormed.\n\n\u201cI just remember seeing it in front of him,\u201d the valet said of a card given to Trump as he watched the riot on television. \u201cI don\u2019t remember how it got there or whatever. But there was no, like, reaction.\u201d\n\nThe woman who was killed, Ashli Babbitt, has become a martyr to the Trumpist far right. Trump has called her a \u201cgreat patriot\u201d. The police officer who shot her outside the House chamber was cleared of wrongdoing, a judgment with which Trump disagreed.\n\nEight other deaths, including law enforcement suicides, are now linked to the Capitol attack, which happened after Trump told supporters to \u201cfight like hell\u201d to overturn Biden\u2019s win, which according to Trump\u2019s lie was the result of electoral fraud.\n\nMore than 1,200 arrests have been made over the riot and hundreds of convictions and sentences secured. Trump was impeached for inciting an insurrection but acquitted by Senate Republicans. He is now the presumptive Republican nominee for president, despite facing 88 criminal charges (14 concerning election subversion) and multimillion-dollar penalties in civil lawsuits. The US supreme court rejected attempts to keep Trump off the ballot under the 14th amendment to the constitution, which bars insurrectionists from office.\n\nThe Times said it obtained the redacted transcript of the valet\u2019s testimony from House Republicans who claim the January 6 committee omitted from its hearings and report anything that did not suit its narrative.\n\nTranscripts contradicting sensational testimony from Cassidy Hutchinson, a close aide to Trump\u2019s final chief of staff, Mark Meadows, have already been released.\n\nBarry Loudermilk of Georgia, the Republican leading the effort to undermine the work of the January 6 committee, told the Times there was \u201csome testimony in [the valet transcript] that may not be favorable to Trump\u201d but said: \u201cWe\u2019re putting it all out there, not doing what the select committee did, and putting things out there that will be favorable to our side.\u201d\n\nBennie Thompson, the Mississippi Democrat who chaired the January 6 committee, which included two anti-Trump Republicans, told the Times: \u201cDespite Mr Loudermilk\u2019s attempts to rewrite the violent history of January 6, the facts laid out in the select committee\u2019s final report remain undisputed \u2013 and nothing substantive was left out nor hidden.\n\n\u201cWhile the valet did not witness everything that happened in the White House that day, the testimony confirms Trump\u2019s indifference to the violence and his anger at Vice-President Pence for performing his duty under the constitution.\u201d\n\nThe unnamed valet said he did not remember Trump calling Pence what the Times called \u201can expletive meant to refer to a wimp\u201d, otherwise widely reported to have been the word \u201cpussy\u201d.\n\nAs the Times noted, Trump has not disputed the insult that was described to the January 6 committee by a former chief of staff to Ivanka Trump, the former president\u2019s daughter.\n\nThe valet also said he did not remember Trump or any staff member commenting on how rioters chanted for Pence to be hanged. Hutchinson told the committee she heard aides saying Trump said Pence \u201cdeserved\u201d such a fate.\n\nThe valet said he heard Trump ask aides about how to send national guard troops to the Capitol, a deployment that took several hours as chaos reigned and a contentious issue since.\n\nThe valet also described \u201cdisbelief\u201d among White House staff as the situation at the Capitol worsened and Trump persisted in watching TV.\n\nPence escaped the rioters and ultimately returned to the Capitol to preside over certification, despite objections from 147 Republicans in the House and Senate. According to Trump\u2019s valet, the president \u201cjust mentioned that Mike let him down, and that was it\u201d.\n\nTrump has been proved right, however, about Pence committing a \u201cpolitical career killer\u201d. Portrayed as a hero by the January 6 committee, Pence ran against Trump for the Republican presidential nomination. Failing to make an impact, he withdrew well before the first primary vote.\n\nLast week, he exacted a measure of revenge \u2013 by refusing to endorse Trump in his rematch with Biden.\n\nBut Pence also said his differences with Trump were \u201cnot personal\u201d \u2013 and refused to say he would not vote for him.\n\nNews Related",

Project 2025 is a detailed presidential transition plan that identifies policies and personnel to accomplish this transformation. It was developed by a Heritage Foundation-led coalition with a $22 million budget.\n\n(Note: If you find my posts too long to read on occasion, please just skim the bolded portions. Thanks for reading my blog! Special Note: The new, more user-friendly website for my blog is here.)\n\nIt becomes clearer by the day that the plan for the next Trump presidency is for an authoritarian dictatorship. This is not just Trump making crazy off-the-cuff statements; it\u2019s a written plan that right-wing organizations and people are advancing every day.\n\nProject 2025 is a detailed presidential transition plan that identifies policies and personnel to transform our democracy into an authoritarian Trump presidency in 2025. It was developed by a Heritage Foundation-led coalition of over 65 right-wing organizations with a $22 million budget. The Heritage Foundation, founded in 1973, a formerly conservative and now revolutionary think tank, has played a leading role in shaping Republican policies since 1980. It\u2019s part of the well-funded network of right-wing groups that have transformed the Republican Party and the Supreme Court. [1]\n\nProject 2025 lays out specific plans to transform the presidency, the executive branch of government, and all our democratic institutions into an authoritarian, strongman-led government. (See this previous post for more details.) If Trump is elected, its authors and supporters will aggressively implement the plan. As Kevin Roberts, president of the Heritage Foundation said, \u201c[T]he Trump administration [in 2016], with the best of intentions, simply got a slow start. And Heritage and our allies in Project 2025 believe that must never be repeated.\u201d [2]\n\nI used to regard the Heritage Foundation as a very conservative but thoughtful contributor to policy debates. This is no longer true. The dramatic change came when Kevin Roberts was appointed its president in 2021. It abruptly changed; for example, it shifted from supporting Ukraine against Russia\u2019s invasion to supporting Russia. Some staff members resigned because of this and other changes. It\u2019s now fully embracing authoritarianism, ending our democracy, and \u201cinstitutionalizing Trumpism.\u201d\n\nYou probably know that Hungarian authoritarian Prime Minister Victor Orban recently visited former president Trump at Mar-a-Lago. And you probably know that Orban upended Hungarian democracy, replacing it with authoritarianism, including gutting civil service and filling government positions with his loyalists, taking over businesses to benefit friends and family, and attacking the rights of immigrants, women, and LGBTQ+ people.\n\nWhat you may not have heard is that Orban also visited Washington, D.C. Despite being Hungary\u2019s Prime Minister, he did not meet with any government officials. Instead, he met privately with right-wing luminaries and politicians at the headquarters of the Heritage Foundation. Its president, Kevin Roberts, is a big fan of Orban\u2019s and the Heritage Foundation has established a formal partnership with the Hungarian Danube Institute, which is basically a government-funded front for Orban\u2019s propaganda. The Danube Institute has given grants to right-wing entities in the U.S. It\u2019s not known if the Heritage Foundation is one of those entities, but it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise if it was.\n\nThere\u2019s an in-depth article on the Project 2025 plan for a Trump presidency in The American Prospect magazine. [3] For example, the Justice Department would be used to prosecute Trump\u2019s political and civilian adversaries. The Insurrection Act would be invoked so the military could be used to crush any protests. The plan includes a long list of enemies and how to target them, including everyone from federal civil servants to business and environmental regulators to union leaders to safety net beneficiaries.\n\nProject 2025 includes a key strategy for quickly implementing the plan: immediately install loyal Deputy Directors (who don\u2019t require Senate confirmation) across the federal bureaucracy and fire all the senior managers who require Senate confirmation. Under federal law, the deputies then become acting heads of the agencies.\n\nProject 2025 states that the Department of Defense (DOD) \u201chas emphasized leftist politics over military readiness\u201d and that the DOD needs to \u201celiminate Marxist indoctrination.\u201d It encourages rigorous review of all senior officers, i.e., generals and admirals, to ensure they \u201cprioritize the core roles and responsibilities of the military over social engineering and non-defense matters.\u201d This sounds like the implementation of an ideological purity test for military leaders.\n\nProject 2025 would increase economic inequality by favoring the wealthy and large corporations. It calls for cutting taxes on unearned income, i.e., capital gains and dividend income. It calls for lowering the corporate tax rate (which has already been reduced by the 2017 Trump / Republican tax cut bill), privatizing every government function possible, and deregulating every industry. It would incentivize corporations to limit employee benefits by capping the amount that could be treated as an expense to $12,000. It would end congressional approval of arms sales to foreign countries. It would basically eliminate scientists and scientific studies from any role in policy making except for studies of \u201cthe risks and complications of abortion.\u201d It would put Christian nationalism at the center of all policy-making and government activities.\n\nProject 2025 would gut current environmental and climate change policies. It would repeal the tax credits for clean-energy companies and ensure climate change deniers are appointed to all relevant agencies and bodies, including the EPA\u2019s Science Advisory Board. It would support the fossil fuel industry while cutting funding for improvements to the electric grid that are necessary for using renewable energy sources. [4]\n\nEven if Trump himself is incompetent and mercurial, Project 2025 would put in place bureaucrats and procedures in all executive branch agencies that would be focused on and effective at implementing the authoritarian government it envisions. The complete Project 2025 plan itself is here, but at close to 1,000 pages it\u2019s a lot to wade through.\n\n[1] Swan, J., Savage, C., & Haberman, M., 7/17/23, \u201cTrump and allies forged plans to increase presidential power in 2025,\u201d The New York Times\n\n[2] Richardson, H.

            "text": "The Biden administration approved another round of student debt discharge for more than 78,000 borrowers under the public service loan forgiveness (PSLF) program that impacts teachers, nurses, firefighters, social workers, and other public servants, including the military.\n\nThe discharged amount totals $5.8 billion in student loan debt. The total debt relief under PSLF is now $62.5 billion for 871,000 borrowers since October 2021.\n\nUnder the previous administration, only 2%, or around 7,000 PSLF borrowers, received forgiveness.\n\n\u201cFor too long, our nation\u2019s teachers, nurses, social workers, firefighters, and other public servants faced logistical troubles and trap doors when they tried to access the debt relief they were entitled to under the law,\u201d Miguel Cardona, US Secretary of Education, said in a press release. \u201cToday, more than 100 times more borrowers are eligible for PSLF than there were at the beginning of the administration.\u201d\n\nImpacted borrowers will receive an email from the Education Department notifying them of the discharge.\n\nThe White House also announced that an additional 380,000 PSLF borrowers will be notified that they are eligible for discharge within the next two years. The amount of that debt has not been disclosed yet.\n\nRead more: Do I qualify for student loan forgiveness?\n\nPSLF loan discharge for military and other professions\n\nTeachers, nurses, doctors, lawyers, and other professionals who work in public service jobs with federal, state, local, or certain non-profit organizations are eligible to have their remaining loan balances discharged after 10 years of payments through the PSLF program.\n\nPSLF is also available for military service members who don\u2019t qualify for other military loan forgiveness programs.\n\nThe number of PSLF borrowers who received a discharge increased because of a settlement following a lawsuit from the American Federation of Teachers (AFT). The AFT sued the Education Department in 2019 after more than 98% of borrowers who applied for the PSLF program were denied loan forgiveness when Betsy DeVos was US Education Secretary under the Trump administration.\n\nRead more: Student loan issues? Here's how to file a complaint with the Department of Education\n\nIn the past, PSLF borrowers complained about the amount of paperwork, having to mail documents, and the lack of an easy online process.\n\nIn 2022, the Biden administration introduced the PSLF Help Tool, which allows borrowers to complete the entire PSLF application process online. Another improvement for PSLF borrowers is the ability to digitally track the status of their applications in the \u201cMy Activity\u201d section of borrowers\u2019 StudentAid.gov account.\n\nTo date, the Biden administration has forgiven $143.6 billion in student loan debt for 3.96 million borrowers.\n\nIn addition to relief given to PSLF borrowers, 959,700 borrowers have received $47.3 billion in discharge through the SAVE income-driven repayment (IDR) plan and the one-time IDR adjustment; 513,000 borrowers with a total and permanent disability received $11.7 billion in debt discharges; and over 1.3 million borrowers who were defrauded by their schools received $22.5 billion in discharges under the borrower defense discharge, according to the Education Department.\n\nRonda is a personal finance senior reporter for Yahoo Finance and attorney with experience in law, insurance, education, and government.

            "text": "Biden Campaign Distances Itself From Mysterious Big Dem Donor 'Chairman G'\n\nAuthored by Soobin Kim and Bradley Hope via whalehunting.projectbrazen.com,\n\nLast fall, we reported on a man named Gaurav Srivastava who pretended to be a CIA operative to allegedly fleece the sanctioned Dutch oil trader Niels Troost. The ruse was simple, according to extensive recorded conversations: hand over half your company to me, a secret spy, and I'll protect you from the US government because ... I'm a secret spy.\n\nIn the following months since our original article, it emerged that Srivastava \u2013 or \"Chairman G,\" as he likes to be called \u2013 is a big time political donor in the United States.\n\nWhale Hunting can exclusively reveal that FBI agents in Los Angeles have been interviewing Srivastava\u2019s current and former associates about his campaign donations, claims of being a federal officer and other financial affairs.\n\nWe also confirmed from a staff member for the Washington State Democratic Party that the Biden campaign is in the process of quietly refunding thousands of dollars of his political donations.\n\nThe FBI inquiries \u2014 ongoing for last several months \u2014 may lead nowhere, but the Biden campaign\u2019s decision to start refunding donations suggests there are deeper issues afoot for Srivastava.\n\n\u201cAll allegations raised in this story are false,\" a spokesman for Srivastava told us (full statement and more details on the news after the jump).\n\nThe culmination of Srivastava\u2019s rise to public life came alongside a more than $1 million donation in 2022 to the Atlantic Council, a DC-based think tank. The money underwrote a conference in Bali, where he was a \u201cco-host\u201d and rubbed shoulders with business magnates, political honchos and John Legend.\n\nBut that relationship isn\u2019t going smoothly. The Atlantic Council terminated its relationship with Srivastava, Politico reported last month, and returned additional funds donated by Srivastava in 2023.\n\n\u201cWe made the decision to terminate our relationship with Mr. Srivastava in May 2023 upon learning new information because of our donor review process. For example, we learned that The Gaurav & Sharon Srivastava Family Foundation was not an established 501C3 in April of 2023, despite Mr. Srivastava\u2019s representation to the Council that this was a registered foundation,\u201d the spokesperson told Politico.\n\nSrivastava\u2019s lawyer told Politico the Atlantic Council made the decision after they \u201cdisagreed\u201d about how a gift would be implemented. (Small note: Recipients of gifts usually try very hard to implement the handover of gifts.)\n\nAlongside his campaign to solve global food security he also became a big spender on political campaigns. Among Srivastava\u2019s key advisors for how to best disperse funds for political purposes were Greg Schultz (Biden\u2019s 2020 campaign manager) and Ret. General Wesley Clark. They didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe Federal Election Commission\u2019s database of individual contributions shows that Srivastava contributed at least $1 million to political campaigns and committees in the United States. As an Indian national he is eligible to donate to political campaigns as a Green Card holder. Lo and behold, the donations led to a photo op with Biden which you can find here.\n\nSince 2022, Srivastava has made sizeable donations \u2013 including over $500,000 to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and $500,000 to Senate Majority PAC.\n\nOne mystery we are continuing to investigate: Whale Hunting discovered publicly available evidence suggesting Srivastava contributed over $116,000 using the personal details of an individual with the same name who resides in the same city. The funds were donated under the previous employer, occupation and mailing address of the namesake, who denies making the donations.\n\nIt's unclear how those donations were made. Impersonating another individual to make a political contribution is strictly prohibited by law.\n\nThe single biggest recipient for the donations made with the namesake's personal details was the Biden Victory Fund, a joint fundraising committee for Joe Biden\u2019s 2024 re-election, which received $50,000. About a dozen state Democratic parties across the U.S. also received funds through the Biden Victory Fund.\n\n\"The Biden campaign is aware of the issue and the donation is in the process of being refunded,\" a staff member with Washington State Democratic Party, which received these funds, told Whale Hunting in an email.\n\nIt's unclear the exact allegations the FBI is investigating, but among the questions they've presented current and former associates of Srivastava have been queries about his political spending, source of funds, involvement in international money transfers and other topics related to the allegations already aired publicly about Srivastava in a litany of lawsuits.\n\nSrivastava's spokesman's full comment here:\n\nAll allegations raised in this story are false. The source for this story and others, including 87 paid stories on obscure websites, is tied to a Russian asset facilitating the unfettered trade of Russian oil as made clear by the U.K. sanctions. There\u2019s a direct through-line between Russia, a barrel of oil and the high price of gas at the pump squeezing the American consumer. The slanderous suggestion of a fabricated relationship between Mr. Srivastava and a U.S. intelligence agency was orchestrated by the same Russian asset relied on as a source for your stories and designed by that Russian asset to put a target on his back, threatening the safety of him, his friends and family.\n\nSo if your year is off to a bad start, think about what Srivastava is now dealing with: being on the Feds\u2019 radar, juggling a glut of lawsuits brought on by all the people he\u2019s allegedly stiffed \u2013 from his former interior designer to former landlord to former business partners \u2013 and witnessing the collapse of his carefully crafted reputation.\n\nIn the meantime, Whale Hunting will be chasing this story to fill its gaping plot holes, one among them being where on earth Chairman G got the funds to make the donations in the first place. If you have any insight, please get in touch!",

            "text": "In a shocking development, new information has come to light regarding the alleged involvement of the Biden Crime family in a vast web of corruption and criminal activity. According to a recent tweet by user Jake (@JakeCan72), the scope of the scandal extends far beyond what was previously known, implicating more countries, more individuals, and more nefarious activities than previously thought.\n\nThe tweet highlights several key points that shed light on the depth of the alleged criminal enterprise. Firstly, it suggests that the Biden Crime family has connections to more countries than just China and Ukraine, indicating a global reach and influence. This raises serious concerns about the extent of their network and the potential implications for international relations.\n\nSecondly, the tweet suggests that more individuals are involved in trafficking activities than just Hunter Biden, the son of President Joe Biden. This revelation points to a larger conspiracy involving multiple actors, further complicating the situation and adding layers of complexity to the investigation.\n\nPerhaps most alarming is the assertion that the corruption extends beyond just family members, implicating a wider network of individuals and organizations. This suggests a systematic pattern of criminal behavior that goes beyond just a few bad actors, raising questions about the integrity of the entire Biden administration.\n\nThe tweet also mentions a web of LLCs (Limited Liability Companies) that allegedly benefitted Joe Biden directly, indicating a level of financial entanglement that could have serious legal implications. This suggests that the corruption may not be limited to just political favors or personal gain, but could involve complex financial arrangements designed to hide illicit activities.\n\nOverall, the information presented in the tweet paints a disturbing picture of a criminal enterprise that is far-reaching and deeply entrenched. The implications of these revelations are staggering, with potential consequences for both domestic and international politics.\n\nAs the story continues to unfold, it is essential that the public remains vigilant and demands accountability from those in power. The allegations of corruption and criminal activity must be thoroughly investigated, and those responsible must be held to account for their actions.\n\nIn conclusion, the latest update on the Biden Crime family scandal is a troubling reminder of the dangers of unchecked power and influence. The information presented in the tweet raises serious questions about the integrity of the Biden administration and the potential impact on global politics. It is crucial that we continue to monitor this story closely and demand transparency and accountability from our leaders.\n\nStay tuned for further updates as this story develops.

The transport and power sectors together account for half of the country's greenhouse gas emissions , but the perception of heavy-handed regulation of those industries risks hurting Biden's reelection bid against rival and former President Donald Trump.Climate researchers told Reuters they agree with official projections from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that the changes to the rules may not have much impact on the U.S. goal to halve national emissions by 2030 from 2005 levels.Amanda Levin, director of policy analysis at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the weakening of the EPA vehicle rule, for example, would still achieve at least 90% of the emissions reductions of the more stringent initial proposal, while the removal of existing gas plants from the EPA power plant rule would deliver 80% of the initial proposal.More important to the US decarbonization target, however, is how fast developers can build zero-emissions power generation and hook it up to the grid - efforts crucial to supporting the EV fleet and which would render the power plant regulation moot. Biden is attempting to spur those industries along by using lucrative subsidies for wind, solar and electric vehicles embedded in the roughly USD 400 billion Inflation Reduction Act.\"The EPA rules serve more as the as a backstop (to the IRA ),\" said O'Boyle.Before the IRA passed in 2022, the U.S. was only on track to reduce its emissions 25%-28% by 2030, according to NRDC's Levin.Both NRDC and energy consultancy the Rhodium Group found in separate analyses that the U.S. is now on track to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 42% by 2030.Still, filling the remaining gap could be tricky.Both the U.S. solar and offshore wind manufacturing industries are pushing the Biden administration for more support, in addition to what is included in the IRA, to ensure they have the financing and economics needed to follow through with their investment plants.O'Boyle and others said additional challenges include permitting and constructing transmission lines required to connect new power generation to consumers.Around 2,000 GW of mainly renewable generation and energy storage are in regional grid interconnection queues across the United States, with recent announced projects - many incentivized by the IRA's tax credits - taking upwards of five years to connect.The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Energy Department are working on reforms aimed at speeding up the interconnection backlog and expanding transmission.Levin of the NRDC said states can also help fill the gap with strengthened renewable energy targets and EV policies, especially as IRA-driven investments hit the ground from California to Texas to Pennsylvania.\"That is a huge piece of the puzzle,\" she said.",

            "text": "rewrite this content and keep HTML tags\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department will file a blockbuster antitrust lawsuit against Apple on Thursday, according to three people familiar with the matter.\n\n\n\nThe long-anticipated lawsuit comes after years of allegations by critics that Apple has harmed competition with restrictive app store terms, high fees and its \u201cwalled-garden\u201d approach to its hardware and software, in which Apple tightly controls how third-party tech companies can interact with the tech behemoth\u2019s products and services.\n\n\n\nFor example, Apple allows iPhone customers to send high-quality photos and videos seamlessly to one another, but multimedia texts to Android phones are slower and grainy. The company late last year relented and agreed to improve the quality standard it uses to interact with Android phones via text message.\n\n\n\nThe company also gives its own products the ability to access certain parts of its hardware that it restricts other companies from using. That unleashes an almost magical experience for how iPhones interact with AirTags, when competitors\u2019 products are far more limited in their capabilities.\n\n\n\nThis year, European regulations forced Apple to give other companies access to the iPhone\u2019s tap-to-pay hardware chip, enabling the creation of competing digital wallets. But those rules are limited to the European Union.\n\n\n\nAnd Apple maintains a large 30 per cent commission on most sales through its app store \u2013 a frequent complaint from companies that try to sell subscriptions, saying Apple\u2019s enormous share of the smartphone market forces them to pay what they argue is an unnecessarily high commission.\n\n\n\nYears of scrutiny\n\n\n\nApple has shrugged off legal challenges and criticism for years that its practices are anticompetitive. Its sterling consumer reputation and a disciplined public relations and legal strategy mirrors the precision in which Apple manufactures and oversees its products.\n\n\n\nBut the Justice Department\u2019s landmark suit is expected to challenge a broad range of Apple\u2019s practices.\n\n\n\nThe case represents the Biden administration\u2019s latest effort to hold a Big Tech giant accountable under US antitrust law. Apple is the only major tech company the federal government has yet to sue for alleged antitrust violations.\n\n\n\nApple was named in a sprawling House report in 2020 finding that the iPhone maker, along with Meta, Google and Amazon, hold \u201cmonopoly power.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe legal action could weigh on Apple\u2019s stock price that currently values the company at just under US$3 trillion and could force changes to policies, business strategies, products and applications by the tech giant. Even divestment of some assets is not out of the question for Apple, the tech company founded by Steve Jobs in the 1970s.\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s (AAPL) stock fell less than one per cent Thursday. The lawsuit was widely anticipated.\n\n\n\nAlong with a pair of ongoing antitrust cases against Google, the DOJ lawsuit against Apple is likely to become a symbol of the Biden administration\u2019s commitment to competition and lowering prices. It will also be a test of how far courts are willing to go to apply decades-old antitrust law to the modern digital economy.\n\n\n\nThis is a developing story and it will be updated.",

Bank records were introduced showing the transfers of millions to Hunter and various Biden family members. The evidence suggests that the president may have lied about his lack of any knowledge or involvement in the influence peddling.\n\nDuring the hearing, Rep. Dan Goldman was noted for eliciting damaging answers from witnesses, often raising the worst evidence that his colleagues have avoided. In one instance, he brought up a WhatsApp message where Hunter told a Chinese businessman that his father would not be pleased unless he sent him money. On another occasion, he prompted an IRS whistleblower to note that an email Goldman read into the record was actually a direct contradiction of the president\u2019s denials.\n\nIn the latest misstep, Goldman pressed former Biden partner Tony Bobulinski on a proposal shared with Hunter and others to reserve 10% for the \u201cBig Guy\u201d. Bobulinski was told to use such codes to avoid mentioning Joe Biden\u2019s name, who was expressly identified as the \u201cBig Guy\u201d. When asked if anyone ever responded to that email, Bobulinski responded, \u201cYes, they did, numerous times. Hunter himself did.\u201d\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez challenged Bobulinski, asking him to name the crime. Bobulinski proceeded to list a series of possible criminal acts, which Ocasio-Cortez cut off, demanding a specific crime. The exchange highlighted the hearing\u2019s absurdity as Democrats demanded evidence and then ignored it when it was repeatedly offered by witnesses and members.\n\nIt is widely agreed that Hunter was openly engaging in influence peddling, a form of corruption that the government has long fought against. It is also clear that Joe Biden knew of that influence peddling, not just from his son but from newspaper accounts. He had knowledge of the corruption and facilitated it. However, Democrats have been accused of allowing their identity to drip through their open fingers, becoming a party that calls for censorship, ballot cleansing, and court packing, while excusing raw influence peddling after opposing every effort to investigate it. By the end of the hearing, virtually every Democratic member had attacked the witnesses and denied the obvious corruption surrounding the Biden family.",

            "text": "Experts hate to be improper. Once I first began writing concerning the public\u2019s hostility towards experience and established data greater than a decade in the past, I predicted that any variety of crises\u2014together with a pandemic\u2014may be the second that snaps the general public again to its senses. I used to be improper. I didn\u2019t foresee how some residents and their leaders would reply to the cycle of advances and setbacks within the scientific course of and to the inevitable limitations of human consultants.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic, specifically, would show the right crucible for accelerating the decline of religion in consultants. Paranoia and appeals to ignorance have lengthy been a part of the American political setting, however they have been particularly damaging at a time when the U.S. was riven by partisan hostility. The pandemic struck at a number of political and cultural weaknesses throughout the edifice of American life: A mysterious illness\u2014from China, no much less, a nation that usually serves as a supply of American nervousness\u2014compelled residents to depend on the media, together with retailers that lots of them already distrusted, for scattered items of data from white-jacketed consultants and comparatively unknown authorities officers.\n\nMany elected leaders, particularly on the nationwide degree, failed the truth is to steer. The dysfunction of President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, on COVID-19 and on so many different points, has been amply documented in quite a few books and articles. Regardless of the simple success of Operation Warp Velocity, the federal government\u2019s crash program to work with personal business to develop a vaccine in report time, Trump and his individuals have a lot to reply for\u2014together with the hesitancy they engendered amongst People to take the very vaccines that his administration helped develop.\n\nThe highway to America\u2019s pandemic meltdown, nonetheless, didn\u2019t start with Trump. When the coronavirus arrived, a big variety of People have been already primed by the media, their political leaders, and their very own cussed narcissism to reject skilled recommendation throughout a disaster. The collapse of gatekeeping authority within the media, the explosion of nugatory on-line sources, the emergence of movie star pseudo-experts, and the unwarranted self-confidence of tens of millions of people that believed that they may merely \u201cdo their very own analysis,\u201d because the web mantra has it, all mixed to make a brutal outbreak of illness much more lethal.\n\nLearn: The coronavirus-denial motion now has a pacesetter\n\nHowever, the place the demise of experience is anxious, the scientific neighborhood and its allies within the public-policy enviornment made two elementary errors early on. One is that they tried to take the place of elected officers: They issued steering and coverage directions whereas making an attempt to fill the vacuum left by poor management in Washington, D.C., and different areas of the USA. And on the top of the lockdowns, medical doctors and native authorities in some cities made a nakedly political calculation about whether or not and when their ostensibly agency pandemic restrictions could possibly be ignored.\n\nMasks and lockdowns have been among the many most divisive pandemic measures. As regular, Trump was resolutely ignorant and self-centered. He and his motion coalesced round depicting such public-health measures as symbols of presidency autocracy. At a July 2020 White Home assembly, Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, suggested him to advocate for masks mandates, which at that time even most Republicans supported. Trump\u2019s chief of employees, Mark Meadows, objected. \u201cWe will\u2019t do the masks,\u201d he informed the president. \u201cThe bottom will simply activate you.\u201d Trump sided with Meadows.\n\nHowever lots of Trump\u2019s opponents themselves adopted a blinkered insistence on such mandates as their very own model of political signaling. In an already polarized setting, both sides hoisted their flags and charged into battle\u2014with scant regard for proof or skilled recommendation.\n\nThe scientists unwisely stepped into this mess, with predictable outcomes. The American public has little tolerance for nuance or complexity, and the suggestions on masks carrying have been troublesome to parse and modified over time. What sort of masks would work finest? (An N-95 respirator\u2014if worn accurately.) Would fabric masks work? Bandannas, possibly? (In all probability not very effectively.) Ought to masks be worn all over the place? Indoors, outdoor\u2014even at house?\n\nThe general public needed clear and unambiguous solutions that the scientists couldn\u2019t give them: sure or no, protected or unsafe, on or off. Woefully unaccustomed to explaining difficult points to peculiar residents, they made a hash of the messaging and easily tried to push for masks as a generic measure, till many People\u2014even those that needed to be cooperative\u2014gave up.\n\nAdvocates for lockdowns and strict masking guidelines argued that they\u2019d the stronger level in a time of uncertainty. Such prophylactic measures, they contended, even when ragged and inconsistent, have been higher than flatly ignoring manifest public-health risks. However \u201cfollowing the science\u201d means following all of the science, and these inflexible, dogmatic responses downplayed the truth that the science was additionally displaying that some COVID-19 insurance policies did, the truth is, carry a damaging value. The lockdowns, because the COVID Disaster Group (a nonpartisan assortment of students and scientists) famous later, weren\u2019t an answer however a \u201csledgehammer\u201d that took the place of higher preparation and resulted from an incapacity to agree on nearly anything.\n\nThe next prolonged closure of public areas within the U.S. produced deep social and financial wounds, however the controversy over when to reopen colleges was a very essential space of skilled failure. The closures of instructional establishments went on too lengthy in lots of elements of the nation, ensuing in emotional and mental injury to American college students.\n\nLearn: Paging Dr. Hamblin: Why didn\u2019t America\u2019s shutdowns work?\n\nMany progressives, nonetheless, bitterly contested rising proof each that in-person education was comparatively protected and that faculty closures had created catastrophic studying loss. This was in lots of circumstances a cussed response, a sort of polar opposition to the stubborn individuals on the fitting who dismissed nearly all pandemic measures as oppression. For the left, because the New York journal columnist Jonathan Chait later famous, \u201cthe proof did ultimately win out,\u201d whereas the Republicans descended into an \u201cepistemic catastrophe\u201d that persists to this present day.\n\nSadly, the proof didn\u2019t win out in time to stop hurt, particularly in colleges. Public-school mother and father needed their kids to be again within the classroom, however many lecturers have been hesitant, and one among their largest unions, the American Federation of Lecturers, and its chief, Randi Weingarten, have been proof against the purpose of militancy. Weingarten warned in July 2020 that the AFT would possibly even help strikes if lecturers have been compelled again to the classroom.\n\nThe stress from the AFT had a transparent impact on nationwide coverage subsequently. Inside weeks of taking workplace in 2021, President Joe Biden backpedaled on his marketing campaign guarantees to open colleges. In line with my Atlantic colleague Franklin Foer, Biden acquiesced to writing off the remainder of the tutorial yr as \u201cthe value of peace\u201d with the union.\n\nThe lecturers\u2019 considerations have been comprehensible, however the intransigence of a few of their union leaders did vital hurt to their already battered standing. In the meantime, over those self same months, one other skilled neighborhood\u2014this time, medical professionals\u2014needlessly inflicted a grievous wound on the impartiality of their very own experience.\n\nOn Might 25, 2020, a white police officer murdered a Black man named George Floyd throughout an arrest in Minneapolis. The incident was captured on video and protests quickly broke out throughout America.\n\nMedical doctors and scientists had an issue on their arms. Floyd\u2019s killing produced an outpouring of grief and anger: People needed to collect, they needed to help each other, they needed to vent their fury, they usually needed to shout their calls for for justice into the face of their authorities. And but due to COVID-19 restrictions, most People couldn\u2019t congregate in public. They may not go to church or sing in a choir. They may not have a good time their marriages, bury their useless, and even, in some areas, meet outdoor for a picnic. Schoolchildren have been nonetheless trapped of their house.\n\nAmerica\u2019s cities have been starting to boil, and public-safety officers confronted a no-win scenario: If states and localities tried to suppress the demonstrations, their instructions can be ignored. But when they allowed the protests, they have been admitting that the pandemic restrictions have been capricious guidelines that would bend within the political wind. How might one trigger be essential sufficient to permit 1000\u2019s upon 1000\u2019s of individuals to collect in shut proximity, whereas all different residents have been informed that their rights\u2014together with their freedom to worship and to interact in peaceable meeting\u2014have been secondary to the wants of public well being and that they have to keep house?\n\nLearn: Going through a COVID-19 resurgence and unable to behave\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci was on the time the director of the Nationwide Institute of Allergy and Infectious Illnesses and one of many the U.S. authorities\u2019s fundamental public-health spokespeople. He would later enter right-wing demonology caricatured as a leftist authoritarian, however in June 2020 he gave one of the diplomatic and smart solutions to be discovered among the many scientists:\n\nIt\u2019s a troublesome scenario. We\u2019ve got the fitting to peacefully display and the demonstrators are exercising that proper \u2026 It\u2019s a fragile steadiness as a result of the explanations for demonstrating are legitimate and but the demonstration itself places oneself at an extra threat. The one factor we are able to do as public-health officers is to maintain warning individuals to watch out. And if you\u2019ll exit, please ensure you put on a masks and you retain the masks on always.\n\nDifferent medical doctors, nonetheless, have been keen to indicate solidarity with the protests. In June 2020, greater than 1,200 medical professionals signed an open letter supporting the demonstrations, casting Floyd\u2019s demise as a well being menace on the identical degree because the pandemic. \u201cInfectious illness and public well being narratives adjoining to demonstrations in opposition to racism have to be consciously anti-racist, and infectious illness consultants have to be clear and constant in prioritizing an anti-racist message,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWhite supremacy is a deadly public well being problem that predates and contributes to COVID-19.\u201d\n\nNoble if stilted rhetoric, however even individuals who empathized with the protesters needed to discover that the earlier strict prohibitions on gathering have been now, for the sake of an essential political trigger, apparently negotiable. In line with The Washington Publish, Ranu S. Dhillon, an infectious-disease skilled at Harvard Medical Faculty, characterised the protests as dangerous however crucial\u2014similar to working in a nursing house or grocery retailer, an strategy that confirmed how out of contact many professionals have been with peculiar individuals who have been afraid to go to aged relations or go to the market.\n\nThe obtainable proof doesn\u2019t to this point recommend that the protests created a significant surge in COVID-19 infections. However to argue that the sudden reversal in public-health recommendation didn\u2019t lead to extra infections is a publish hoc rationalization\u2014and, for consultants, a lure.\n\nOn the time, the medical steering was clear that folks mustn\u2019t collect in massive teams or be in proximity, and positively not whereas singing and shouting. If medical doctors believed that the dangers of such gatherings could possibly be mitigated with masks or by being outdoor, they need to have already been urgent for the lifting of the strictest measures all over the place, with the identical recommendation they gave protesters. But when they have been nonetheless holding to the theories that underpinned the lockdowns\u2014and particularly the varsity closures\u2014then their approval of the demonstrations meant they have been consciously setting apart these considerations within the title of a political trigger with which they agreed.\n\nBoth means, they have been performing as advocates moderately than scientists. Within the phrases of the environmental journalist Peter M. Sandman, they \u201cclearly broken the credibility of public well being as a scientific enterprise that struggles to be politically impartial.\u201d\n\nThe world pandemic emergency is formally over, and the consultants are nonetheless assessing what they did proper and improper\u2014as they need to. However within the U.S., the political injury from the coronavirus wars stays. Essentially the most intrusive measures, together with lockdowns and masking, are lengthy gone. For many People, particularly the aged and different weak teams, avoiding probably the most critical penalties of COVID-19 has change into mainly a matter of getting vaccinated and staying present on booster photographs, as they\u2019d with flu and pneumonia.\n\nAnd but, the U.S. nonetheless lags the remainder of the developed world in safety in opposition to COVID-19. In line with the CDC\u2019s newest information, from 2023, some 70 p.c of People obtained an preliminary vaccination, however fewer than 20 p.c have had any booster. The charges are a lot better amongst individuals over 65, who\u2014for numerous causes, together with their consciousness of the illness\u2019s elevated hazard for his or her age group\u2014are extra attentive to getting vaccinated.\n\nThe last word numbers, nonetheless, obscure the deep political divisions over vaccination, preventive measures, and science itself. A New York Instances/Siena ballot in 2023 discovered that almost 70 p.c of possible Republican voters would belief \u201cthe widespread sense of peculiar individuals\u201d over \u201cthe data of educated consultants.\u201d (In a Pew ballot a yr earlier, 51 p.c of People stated that public-health officers had achieved a wonderful or good job at managing the pandemic, however that quantity was anchored by the 72 p.c of Democrats who felt that means; solely 29 p.c of Republicans agreed.)\n\nTrump, after all, has continued his crude deployment of ignorance and concern in his second bid to regain the American presidency. When new variants of the virus started to unfold in the summertime of 2023, Trump launched a video decrying the \u201ctyrants\u201d who have been going to impose new pandemic mandates. \u201cWe won\u2019t comply,\u201d he stated, defying measures that didn\u2019t really exist. Thankfully, most individuals in the USA now have some degree of immunity, and governments in any respect ranges have discovered an awesome deal about monitoring and treating the illness.\n\nNonetheless, because the COVID Disaster Group famous in 2023, \u201cone key predictor of infections and whole COVID deaths\u201d in every state in the course of the pandemic \u201cwas the share of people who voted for President Trump within the 2020 presidential election.\u201d Or, as a member of the group remarked in an summary of the pandemic\u2019s course and the American lives misplaced, \u201cTrump was a comorbidity.\u201d\n\nJay Varma: The general public-health calculus has shifted\n\nThe consultants failed at some essential factors, particularly within the early days of the pandemic, however a lot of what the general public believed to be failure was higher described as science\u2014the best way that data itself is developed as consultants labored by way of a brand new drawback with restricted information. They argued and examined competing explanations and options. Such debates and discussions, together with the inevitable prices of trial and error throughout a time of emergency, are the traditional processes of scientific investigation. However America\u2019s political setting in 2020, poisoned by ignorance and inflexible tribalism, just about assured that the majority points of the pandemic response\u2014each failures and successes\u2014would change into divisive and partisan points.\n\nSpecialists are fallible human beings, and they\u2019re going to generally give poor recommendation or make errors. However a sophisticated society and its authorities can not do with out them, it doesn\u2019t matter what a big variety of People appear to imagine. To disregard skilled recommendation is solely not a sensible possibility: Coverage making is complicated, and residents have some accountability to remain knowledgeable about points that straight have an effect on their very own well-being. Specialists at all times must do not forget that they\u2019re the servants, not the masters, of a democratic society and a republican authorities. However as James Madison presciently warned, if residents are to be the authors of their very own destiny, they have to first equip themselves with data, after which follow the civic advantage based mostly on motive and cooperation that makes an knowledgeable democracy attainable.\n\nEarlier than the following disaster\u2014and there\u2019ll at all times be one other\u2014residents, consultants, and coverage makers have to interact in a troublesome debate concerning the position of consultants and educated elites in American democracy. For now, such potentialities have been thwarted by the partisan fight that erupted after the coronavirus pandemic. I nonetheless believe that we are able to, in some unspecified time in the future, embrace the reality-based understandings we as soon as accepted as apparent: Chief amongst them is that though each single vote in a democracy is as equally legitimate as each different, each single opinion is just not.\n\nAmerica must reestablish new guidelines for productive engagement between the educated elites and the society they serve. However after the political occasions and pure disasters of the previous decade, the creation of a extra productive relationship between the consultants and the general public goes to be a problem, and it\u2019ll require time. The earlier the higher, as a result of the clock, as at all times, is counting right down to the following unknown catastrophe.",

This explosive allegation sheds light on potential corruption within the intelligence community and raises serious questions about the Biden family\u2019s activities, particularly in Ukraine.\n\nAccording to the whistleblower, the CIA moved in August 2021 to prevent IRS investigators from interviewing Kevin Morris, a prominent Hollywood lawyer with ties to Hunter Biden. It\u2019s alleged that DOJ officials were then instructed not to include Morris as a witness in their probe after a meeting at CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia.\n\nThis revelation underscores the complex web of connections between the Biden family and powerful institutions like the CIA. The Bidens have long been accused of questionable dealings in Ukraine, and this latest development suggests that their ties run deeper than previously thought.\n\nAs the spotlight intensifies on these allegations, it\u2019s crucial for transparency and accountability to prevail. The American public deserves to know the truth about the extent of any potential wrongdoing, especially when it involves high-ranking officials and intelligence agencies.\n\nSources:\n\ndailycaller.com/2024/03/21/whistleblower-cia-kevin-moris-hunter-biden-interview-comer-jordan/\n\nvigilantnews.com/post/the-cias-role-in-the-biden-crime-familys-activities-in-ukraine-begin-to-surface/",

            "text": "This article is part of HuffPost\u2019s biweekly politics newsletter. Click here to subscribe.\n\nIt has been 14 years since then-President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act, with Vice President Joe Biden at his side. It was one of that administration\u2019s crowning achievements \u2014 or, as Biden said in a famous hot mic moment, a \u201cbig fucking deal.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, Biden and Obama plan to mark the anniversary with a virtual campaign event, as part of a broader effort to put the law at the center of Biden\u2019s presidential reelection campaign. The idea is to remind voters about what the Affordable Care Act has accomplished \u2015 and what could happen to it if Donald Trump retakes the White House.\n\nThere is a lot to say on both counts.\n\nTens of millions of Americans now get health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, either via expanded state Medicaid programs that the ACA funds or subsidized private coverage that the ACA makes available. Together, those features have brought the proportion of Americans without health insurance to historic lows.\n\nThe law also introduced legal guarantees of coverage for people with preexisting conditions. Those matter because, back in the day, insurance companies could charge higher premiums to people with diabetes or a history of cancer \u2015 or deny them insurance altogether. They could also sell policies that left out whole swaths of coverage, like maternity care or treatment for mental illness.\n\nNow with Trump on the ballot again, those changes could be in jeopardy \u2015 for reasons that are right out in plain view, but aren\u2019t getting the close look they deserve.\n\nRepeal And The Mythical Obamacare Alternative\n\nWhen Trump ran for president in 2016, repealing the law was a central promise. Once he got into office, he and the Republicans in charge of Congress made it their top priority \u2014 and came darn close to succeeding.\n\nLate last year, Trump said he wanted to try again. \u201cThe cost of Obamacare is out of control, plus, it\u2019s not good Healthcare,\u201d he posted on Truth Social in November. \u201cI\u2019m seriously looking at alternatives.\u201d\n\nA few days after that, Trump posted a follow-up: \u201cI don\u2019t want to terminate Obamacare, I want to REPLACE IT with MUCH BETTER HEALTHCARE. Obamacare Sucks!!!\u201d Trump also vowed that he would deliver \u201cmuch better Healthcare than Obamacare for the American people.\u201d\n\nTrump never specified how he\u2019d deliver this \u201cmuch better\u201d health care, which shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. He didn\u2019t spell out a \u201cmuch better\u201d alternative when he was running for president in 2016 either.\n\nTrump\u2019s fellow Republicans are proceeding the same way. A new budget proposal from the Republican Study Committee, which represents the majority of House Republicans, includes key elements of repeal like deep cuts to Medicaid and a rollback of regulations on preexisting conditions.\n\nThe document promises to introduce a system of \u201cpersonalized and affordable health care.\u201d But like Trump, Republicans aren\u2019t providing details about how, exactly, they intend to accomplish that.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s a reason Republican plans are always so vague.\n\nTheir basic goal on health care, as with the rest of their agenda, is to scale back government spending, taxes and regulations of private industry. That serves their interest in shrinking government \u2014 which, in their telling, leads to a more efficient, ultimately more humane health care system.\n\n\n\nBut there\u2019s no escaping the basic math of health care, which is that lots of people can\u2019t get insurance without public programs or financial assistance from government. That is why projections in 2017 consistently showed Republican repeal alternatives would cause the number of uninsured Americans to skyrocket \u2014 and why it\u2019s safe to assume that repeal would have the same results now.\n\n\u201cTrade-offs are inevitable in health reform, like in any complex policy issues,\u201d Larry Levitt, an executive vice president at the health care research organization KFF, told me Friday. \u201cYou can\u2019t just magically produce better coverage at lower costs.\u201d\n\nAs for rolling back the law\u2019s robust protections for people with preexisting conditions, Sarah Lueck, vice president for health policy at left-leaning think tank Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said that would \u201creturn [America] to a time when people\u2019s health history determines whether they can have health insurance, how much they pay, or what benefits they can get.\u201d\n\nThe Political Outlook For Health Care \u2015 And Biden\n\nFear of those consequences was a big reason that repeal proved so unpopular in 2017. That fear would likely be even greater now, given that the program appears to be more popular than ever \u2014 and enrollment in the Affordable Care Act\u2019s private plans is higher than it\u2019s ever been before.\n\nPlenty of Republican lawmakers certainly remember how repeal worked out for them at the ballot box last time. Public anger over the repeal effort was probably the single biggest reason that the GOP lost control of the House in 2018. In the elections two years after that, it was still a political albatross, for both incumbent GOP legislators and Trump himself.\n\nBut it\u2019s easy to forget just how close that repeal effort came to succeeding, even though it was deeply unpopular. Legislation came up just one vote short in the Senate, after all.\n\nIt\u2019s also easy to underestimate Trump\u2019s desire to erase Obama\u2019s signature accomplishment \u2015 and to forget how willing fellow Republicans could be to follow him, as they would on any cause that Trump declares a priority.\n\nAnd the specter of repeal is really just the leading edge of a broader attack on health care programs that many, quite possibly most, Republican legislators endorse \u2015 and that threatens two of Biden\u2019s key policy accomplishments.\n\nOne is an initiative that allows the federal government to negotiate directly with pharmaceutical companies over what Medicare pays for certain high-priced drugs. It became law as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, the sweeping climate and health care bill that Biden and the Democrats enacted in 2022.\n\nThe Republican Study Committee budget calls for rescinding that power, on the theory \u2014 as conservatives have long argued \u2014 that regulating drug prices will ultimately limit profits in ways that make it harder to raise the money necessary for the development of new treatments.\n\nThe other Biden legacy in jeopardy is additional financial assistance to people buying subsidized coverage through the Affordable Care Act. This has reduced the cost of coverage, in some cases by hundreds of dollars or even more than $1,000 a year, so that more people can get coverage and those who already have it can get more generous policies.\n\nBiden and the Democrats first made this extra assistance available in 2021, as part of their COVID-19 pandemic relief efforts, and then extended it in 2022 \u2015 again, in the Inflation Reduction Act. It\u2019s still a temporary measure, though, and set to expire in 2025.\n\nNeither Trump nor his fellow Republicans have had much to say about its future. But given their antipathy toward the Affordable Care Act, it seems unlikely that they\u2019d be enthusiastic about it. And if the program isn\u2019t extended, prices for coverage will go back up.\n\nEven with that extra financial assistance in place, the health care system still has tons of problems. Large swaths of the population struggle to pay medical bills because they don\u2019t have insurance, or the insurance they have isn\u2019t adequate.\n\nBut presented with a choice between turning back the clock to what health care looked like before the reforms that Obama and Biden enacted, or keeping those policies in place, Americans have signaled repeatedly that they prefer the latter.\n\nNow Obama, Biden and their allies want to make sure the public realizes that same choice is on the November ballot. They\u2019re starting that work Saturday.",

            "text": "Today, the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability held a hearing titled, \u201cInfluence Peddling: Examining Joe Biden\u2019s Abuse of Public Office.\u201d Witnesses included Biden family business associates Tony Bobulinski and Jason Galanis who testified that Joe Biden knew about, participated in, and enabled his family\u2019s corrupt influence peddling schemes that made his family over $24 million. Congresswoman Lauren Boebert (CO-03) said, \u201cJoe Biden has leveraged his elected position to enable the Biden family, their business associates, and their shell companies to receive over $24 million dollars from China and other entities. Biden is compromised and a threat to our national security. It is far past time Congress evict the resident in the White House and hold him accountable for selling out the American people.\u201d Background Courtesy of the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability: Biden family business associates Tony Bobulinski and Jason Galanis testified under oath President Joe Biden actively participated in his family\u2019s corrupt business dealings and acted as the closer for deals with Chinese and Russian entities. Mr. Tony Bobulinski, Biden family business associate: \u201cJoe Biden was more than a participant in and beneficiary of his family\u2019s business; he was an active, aware enabler who met with business associates such as myself to further the business, despite being buffered by a complex scheme to maintain plausible deniability.\u201d Mr. Jason Galanis, Biden family business associate: \u201cDuring the May 4th party, we were told to go to an area of the restaurant to gather because Hunter was going to call his father. Hunter called his father, said hello and \u2018hold on, Pops,\u2019 then put the call on speakerphone and said, \u2018I am here with our friends I told you were coming to town, and we wanted to say hello.\u2019 The Vice President said hello and some pleasantries [\u2026] and then seemed like he wanted to bring the call to an end by saying, \u2018Ok then, you be good to my boy.\u2019 Hunter responded by saying, \u2018Everything is good, and we are moving ahead.\u2019 The Vice President said something about \u2018being helpful,\u2019 and Hunter ended the call by saying that he was going to call his father later. [\u2026] A few days after this May 4th party, an email my lawyer provided to this committee shows that Devon had confirmed Ms. Baturina was committed to a \u2018hard order\u2019 of $10-20 million in a Burnham investment banking client.\u201d The Bidens don\u2019t sell a product or a service or a set of skills. President Joe Biden is \u201cthe brand\u201d that the Biden family is selling for millions of dollars to those around the world willing to pay for it. Mr. Tony Bobulinski: \u201cI want to be crystal clear: from my direct personal experience and what I have subsequently come to learn, it is clear to me that Joe Biden was \u2018the Brand\u2019 being sold by the Biden family. His family\u2019s foreign influence peddling operation \u2013 from China to Ukraine and elsewhere \u2013 sold out to foreign actors who were seeking to gain influence and access to Joe Biden and the United States government. Mr. Jason Galanis: \u201cThe entire value-add of Hunter Biden to our business was his family name and his access to his father, Vice President Joe Biden.\u201d House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-Ky.): \u201cThe scam is simple. It\u2019s done over and over again. The Biden family promises Joe\u2019s power, Joe Biden shows up, and millions of dollars come into the Bidens\u2019 pockets. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio): \u201cMillions of dollars from foreign entities run through twenty different companies, for what? Devon Archer told us what it was for: Access to the brand. And the brand was Joe Biden. The brand that played rounds of golf, took calls and meetings, attended lunches and dinners with Hunter Biden and his business partners.\u201d Hunter Biden failed to appear alongside his business associates today because his testimony would not withstand public scrutiny when held up against witness facts and evidence uncovered showing Joe Biden\u2019s involvement in the business schemes. Hunter for months has requested a public hearing, but when offered one alongside his business associates, he failed to show up. Mr. Bobulinski: \u201cHow are the American people supposed to get the unvarnished facts and truth when the son and brother of Joe Biden are willing to perjure themselves to protect the family?\u201d President Joe Biden continues to lie directly to the American people about the central role he played in his family\u2019s corrupt influence peddling schemes. Mr. Tony Bobulinski: \u201cWhy is Joe Biden blatantly lying to the American people? Why has he not simply leveled with the American people about all of the meetings, phone calls, emails and handshakes he has had with the Biden family\u2019s U.S. and foreign business partners, including players from some of America\u2019s most challenging adversaries such as China and Russia, as well as Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Romania and others. If he were doing nothing wrong, why go through this insane exercise of obstructing and denying obvious facts?\u201d The House Committee on Oversight and Accountability released a video exposing Joe Biden\u2019s repeated lies about his family\u2019s influence peddling business. The video uses new footage from recent transcribed interviews with key witnesses who testified today. ###",

            "text": "President Joe Biden on Saturday signed a colossal $1.2 trillion spending package after Congress concluded a tumultuous government funding cycle and skirted a shutdown after midnight.\n\nThe Senate cleared the six-bill funding bundle in a 74-24 vote early Saturday morning, following votes on a dozen Republican amendments and proposals, none of which were successful. The House approved the package earlier on Friday, with more Democrats voting for the massive measure than Republicans as Speaker Mike Johnsonfaces a new threat to his gavel.\n\nBiden signed the bill Saturday afternoon, calling its passage \"a compromise, which means neither side got everything it wanted,\" according to a White House release.\n\nAlmost halfway through the fiscal year, the legislation will deliver fresh budgets and a steady funding stream to the Pentagon and many non-defense agencies through September. The final passage vote caps off an especially rancorous government funding battle that began more than a year ago when House conservatives started demanding deep spending cuts from then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy, despite the reality that the Democrat-led Senate and Biden would never agree to severe reductions.\n\n\u201cAnd after all of that delay \u2014 how different ultimately was the outcome?\u201d Senate Appropriations Chair Patty Murray(D-Wash.) said Friday on the floor.\n\nIn the end, the funding legislation hews closely to the spending levels McCarthy struck with Biden last summer under the bipartisan debt limit agreement, forged before the former speaker disavowed those totals at the behest of his right flank and still lost his gavel last fall. The funding package also leaves out the controversial policy stipulations House Republicans included in their own versions of the funding bills.\n\n\n\nIt got Congress \u201cnowhere,\u201d Murray said, \u201cwhen House Republicans stopped everything to renegotiate the deal they struck with the president, when they insisted on partisan poison pills, when they listened to the loudest voices on the far right \u2014 who, let\u2019s be real, were never going to vote for any bipartisan funding bill.\u201d\n\nAs part of the deal to vote on passage of the package, Senate leaders agreed to hold a vote by April 19 on a bill from Sen. Mike Crapo(R-Idaho) that would bar the Biden administration from carrying out new EPA rules on tailpipe emissions.\n\nBefore final passage, the Senate defeated amendments that would block the release of special immigrant visas, bar the Biden administration from waiving sanctions on Iran and force DHS to detain immigrants accused of crimes like shoplifting. The Senate also rejected an amendment that would cut off federal funding for schools that allow transgender students to play on women\u2019s sports teams, as well as a proposal to bar immigrants accused of assaulting a law enforcement officer from becoming legal U.S. residents or citizens.\n\nAdoption of any amendments would have prompted a multi-day government funding lapse, since the package would be sent back to the House, which adjourned for a two-week recess. Murray opposed many of the amendments with the same message: \"Just like the previous vote, this is a procedural vote that will cause a shutdown.\"\n\nThe spending package could be the last government funding action seen in Congress for a while, at least until lawmakers are likely forced to pass a stopgap spending bill later this year that heads off yet another shutdown threat at the start of the new fiscal year on Oct. 1. With a presidential battle looming in November, serious work on funding bills for next fiscal year is unlikely until after Election Day.\n\n\u201cThe only problem we\u2019ve got now is just the calendar \u2014 going into the election year,\u201d said Arkansas Sen. John Boozman, the top Republican on the appropriations panel that funds the Department of Veterans Affairs and military construction projects.\n\nBoozman predicted deal-making for the upcoming fiscal year will still be less challenging than what appropriators have just struggled through.\n\n\u201cWith a new House, it just takes time to get everything settled. But going through this, I think the next go-round it\u2019ll be easier,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the House, Rep. Mario D\u00edaz-Balart(R-Fla.) said negotiations on the funding package were especially difficult because Democrats are new to their role as the chamber\u2019s minority party.\n\n\u201cIt is always difficult for those who lose the majority to kind of understand that they\u2019ve lost control,\u201d said D\u00edaz-Balart, who chairs the appropriations panel that funds the State Department and Foreign Operations. \u201cIt was a very difficult process. Obviously. It\u2019s taken six months.\u201d\n\nOverall defense funding will increase by about 3 percent under the package, while non-defense funding will remain about even with current levels, because of those bipartisan budget caps that Biden and Johnson reinforced in January.\n\n\n\nBoth sides celebrated several funding increases for their respective priorities under those tight budget constraints.\n\nRepublicans lauded spending bumps for the Pentagon and DHS, including funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement to hold 42,000 people in detention at one time and for 22,000 Border Patrol agents. Democrats touted increased funding for schools serving low-income students, Head Start and child care, along with boosts for research on cancer and Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nBoth the House and Senate are now headed out for a two-week recess. When they return, other priorities will quickly consume both chambers.\n\nHouse Republicans will be under growing pressure to take up the Senate-passed foreign aid funding package, for example, and Johnson may have to defend his speakership after Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene(R-Ga.) filed a motion to strip him of his gavel on Friday.\n\n\u201cAll the precious rules are being broken,\" Greene said earlier in the week, deriding the funding package before announcing her plan to challenge Johnson's post.\n\nHouse Republicans will soon look to elect a new top appropriator, after House Appropriations Chair Kay Granger(R-Texas) announced plans Friday to give up her gavel early, asking her colleagues to choose a successor soon so she can step down. Rep. Tom Cole(R-Okla.), a senior Republican appropriator, is widely seen as the frontrunner for the position.",

Brown\n\nBiden highlighted the impact of the American Rescue Plan (ARP) and emphasized the injection of $1 billion into Nevada to provide affordable housing and housing assistance.\n\nPresident Joe Biden arrived in Las Vegas, Nevada, today to announce a bold plan to tackle the pressing housing crisis gripping the nation. Against skyrocketing housing costs and a severe shortage of affordable homes, the president outlined his strategy to lower housing costs and increase the housing supply for American families.\n\nBiden highlighted the impact of the American Rescue Plan (ARP) and emphasized the injection of $1 billion into Nevada to provide affordable housing and housing assistance. Noteworthy among these investments is the allocation of $700 million towards affordable housing supply, leading to significant developments, including several 200-unit affordable housing projects and approximately 1,000 new senior apartments in Clark County.\n\nBiden\u2019s housing agenda, as detailed in his Fiscal Year 2025 Budget, earmarks a historic $258 billion for housing investments. Key proposals include measures to reduce barriers to homeownership, such as the proposed Mortgage Relief Credit, which would offer middle-class first-time homebuyers a tax credit of $10,000 over two years, along with down payment assistance for first-generation homebuyers and initiatives to lower closing costs.\n\nThe president\u2019s plan also prioritizes increasing housing supply through tax credits, innovative grant funds, and enhanced contributions from financial institutions. Notable among these initiatives are the expansion of the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit and the introduction of a Neighborhood Homes Tax Credit, intended to construct or renovate millions of affordable rental units and starter homes nationwide.\n\nFurthermore, Biden\u2019s plan includes provisions to address unfair rental practices, combat rent gouging by corporate landlords, and eliminate burdensome rental fees. These measures aim to foster a fair rental market while expanding housing choice vouchers to alleviate financial strain on renters.\n\nAcknowledging Nevada\u2019s role in the housing crisis, Biden commended the state\u2019s proactive use of ARP funds, which have facilitated significant strides in affordable housing. Notable achievements include the construction of thousands of new units in Clark County and providing down-payment assistance to hundreds of Nevadans.\n\nPresident Biden\u2019s housing plan arrives at a critical juncture as the nation grapples with the enduring repercussions of the pandemic. With bipartisan support and concerted action, the president\u2019s vision for a more equitable housing landscape promises to transform the American dream into reality for millions across the country.",

Although many Americans and policy wonks see climate change as the major existential issue of our time, it ends up feeling like a relatively small piece of the American political conversation, which is more focused on the economy, immigration and democracy. The climate crisis ends up touching on all of those issues, as CNN\u2019s chief climate correspondent Bill Weir told me. His new book, \u201cLife As We Know It (Can Be): Stories of People, Climate and Hope in a Changing World,\u201d comes out on April 16. We talked on the phone about his recent trip to Massachusetts, where some beachfront homeowners who want the state to do more to help protect the area from erosion and rising sea levels also deny the climate is in crisis. My conversation with Weir, edited for clarity, is below: WOLF: You\u2019re on the ground covering the climate crisis every day. Where has that taken you recently? WEIR: To both ends of the spectrum. It\u2019s the grim reality of what\u2019s unfolding and also, we\u2019re working on a special on innovation. Most recently, I was in Salisbury, Massachusetts, on the New Hampshire border where folks there, over the generations, have watched the high tide get higher, year by year. As is the case along the Atlantic coast, erosion is accelerating along with sea level rise. And so this year, over 100 homeowners banded together, spent $600,000 on 15,000 tons of sand in order to fortify their beachside homes from storms and higher tides. In years past, that would last them three or four years, but then they got yet another freak storm and high tide and most of it was washed away in a single day. They\u2019re coming to grips in various forms with the five stages of climate grief. They very much want the state to kick in. I met some neighbors who refuse to acknowledge climate science and just believe that this is a string of bad luck, a one-off series of unfortunate events. Others are coming around to the to the idea and the actual scientific warnings that Massachusetts is bracing for, officially, a couple of feet of sea level rise above year 2000 levels just in the next decade or two. This $600k defense against sea level rise could have lasted 3 years. It was destroyed in less than a day This was a fascinating case study in the psychology about it, and how people who don\u2019t really acknowledge the warnings of science are the ones most dedicated to saving what\u2019s there now, and so are a vital part of bracing for what\u2019s unfolding. And at the other end of the spectrum?\n\nWEIR: I went down to Florida and met with a couple of inspirational developers. One is Syd Kitson, a former NFL player, who built the first solar power town in America. It\u2019s called Babcock Ranch, Florida. I was riding out Hurricane Ian a few miles away where everything was plunged into darkness and flooded. But because of his designs and ideas, they never lost power and never flooded, and as a result, the demand for people to buy homes in Babcock Ranch has skyrocketed. He\u2019s building them as fast as he can. And so I\u2019m looking at glimpses into how the climate crisis is already changing neighborhoods and which direction we\u2019re likely to go when it comes to construction and food supplies and energy. It\u2019s all changing incredibly fast \u2013 an industrial revolution that nobody\u2019s talking about. See why this Florida town survived Ian unscathed WOLF: You did another story recently about Buffalo as a landing spot for climate refugees. I think it\u2019s interesting that on the one hand, you\u2019re talking to people who are making it so that we can withstand climate change in Florida, but then also thinking about where people are eventually going to have to move because of climate change. How far out is the horizon where we actually see people moving away from the Sunbelt because that\u2019s where people have been moving to for so long? This city rarely reaches 100 degrees. It is now considered a \u2018climate refuge\u2019 WEIR: It\u2019s a fascinating question for different reasons. Five thousand people who were driven out of Puerto Rico by Hurricane Maria went to Buffalo for refuge because there\u2019s a Puerto Rican community there; 3,000 of them stayed. The city embraced that. They need folks to revitalize these Rust Belt towns, and they have a ton of fresh water and clean energy with Niagara Falls. So they\u2019ve declared themselves a climate refuge. For them, it\u2019s not just the latitude, it\u2019s the attitude around migration. At the same time, for the first time in human history, sun and wind energy are the cheapest forms of energy. And so the sun belts, now we\u2019re gonna think of them as the solar belts, and the wind belts, the high plains of Texas, are going to be a huge magnet for big manufacturing who need a lot of abundant energy. Texas now leads the nation in clean energy just because of the economics, despite the politics and ideology. Bright-red Texas is the greenest state right now. The math, the economics of it, is going to change the landscape of what attracts companies, and then as a result, what attracts workers. But ultimately, the heat is going to win. As the belly on the planet becomes more intolerable, the northern latitudes become that much more attractive. Alaska could be the new Florida for retirees. It\u2019ll be a lot wetter up there. But the band of the United States from Portland, Maine, to Portland, Oregon, across the Great Lakes is a refuge that is best positioned for that. The UN predicts tens of millions of folks forced to cross borders by sudden, unnatural disasters. You can see what\u2019s happening on the border now. And as droughts get worse in Central America, you can just play it out. The strain is going to go up. WOLF: It\u2019s interesting to hear you say that about Texas, because the governor and the Republican-dominated legislature there would seemingly be opposed to doing anything specifically because of climate change. But if there\u2019s a capitalist urge, people seem more in tune with it. Joe Biden has tried to make the argument that addressing climate change should be an economic boom. Do you think that even if people are unwilling to accept that climate change is happening, they still might be doing things to address it? WEIR: Oh, absolutely. A story that I don\u2019t get to tell enough is just this massive boom in renewables and clean energy and clean water tech. I think the most recent analysis was for every dollar spent by the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act, five-and-a-half bucks in private investment has chased that. And there are these massive growth rates in the sectors that people aren\u2019t talking about \u2013 carbon removal, thermal storage, using big boxes of hot rocks to store clean energy, using the earth as a battery through pressure, geothermal \u2013 all of these things are exploding now. Scientists have a way of removing carbon dioxide from our oceans\n\nAt the same time, the United States is the biggest petrostate in human history. Joe Biden has exported much more fossil fuels than Donald Trump. It\u2019s the result of this big boom in fracked natural gas. That\u2019s a big sticking point with the environmental wing of his base.\n\nThe big question is how much this new energy boom replaces the old, dirty kind of energy or if we just are so ravenous in our appetites; humanity never cuts back.\n\nIn places like Charleston (South Carolina), where they\u2019re building a billion dollar seawall, and people are raising their 100-year-old mansions on the Battery, it\u2019s not a political debate. It is reality. The physics are right there in your face.\n\nMatt Yglesias is among others who have said we shouldn\u2019t talk too much about climate at all. Because the average person, when it comes to actual action, daily action, doesn\u2019t really want to do it.\n\nWOLF: I\u2019ve wondered about that with regard to electric vehicles. It seems like some people are turned off by them because it\u2019s making a political statement when you buy an EV instead of simply trying to get the best deal.\n\nWEIR: I think what you\u2019re seeing now is there\u2019s been such sudden market saturation that now there\u2019s a backlash, there\u2019s a glut or an oversupply.\n\nThese things happen in fits and starts. Offshore wind was super exciting. And then it hit inflation headwinds and supply chain problems. EVs were a novelty and a statement. And now there\u2019s a tyranny of choice. There\u2019s so many different models and sorting out all the incentives is still not easy.\n\nAt the same time, we\u2019ve crossed the point that I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going back to the internal combustion engine, as a species, the same way there was a certain point we weren\u2019t going back to horses. It just makes more sense.\n\nElectrifying everything is the ultimate result, I think, of all this. It\u2019s just a matter of how fast it takes.\n\nLook at these S-shaped curves of adaptation in history from the color television to the refrigerator that went from, you know, 10% of homes to 95% in a relatively short amount of time. We\u2019ve seen that same thing with solar and battery storage, the same kind of thing with heat pumps. And there\u2019s a big wave of efficiency and cleaner, more sustainable choices coming, regardless of the politics.\n\nWOLF: I read in CNN\u2019s report that it was the warmest winter on record and that the planet was more than 2 degrees over the pre-industrial levels for a number of days in February. It seems clear that we\u2019re going to burst through the 2-degree tipping point that had been previously suggested as the tipping point for climate change. What is the next marker?\n\nWEIR: The hardest thing for most folks to grasp \u2013 I still have a hard time grasping it even though I live in the space every day \u2013 is that the record-shattering year that we just had isn\u2019t just the hottest year in 120,000 years or so. It\u2019s among the coolest years of the rest of our lives.\n\nAnd there has been no meaningful reduction in emissions. The human hand on the global thermostat still has it cranked all the way up. And until that changes, until the atmosphere stabilizes at a certain rate, it\u2019s just going to keep getting warmer.\n\nThe really scary stuff is what we don\u2019t see and what\u2019s much harder to measure and to communicate, which is that the ocean temperatures have broken a record every day for the last year.\n\nEvery new day on the calendar is the hottest such day that we\u2019ve ever recorded. What that means for marine ecosystems and coral reefs, which are the cradles of life in the oceans, and what it means for the power of storms as we head into hurricane season has scientists really, really worried.\n\nWOLF: What are the little things that people should be doing? I don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s realistically asking people to stop travel completely. You travel to cover these stories. How do you layer the climate into your daily life?\n\nWEIR: When you take on this beat, you see everything in life differently. I used to just see an ice cream truck and smile. Now I see the fumes coming off the generator. I think about the sugarcane fields that burn to make delicious treats. Everything has a cost if you really think about it.\n\nI absolutely think about my flight footprint and for years would offset my air miles with clean energy projects that are vetted, charities I believe in.\n\nBut we can\u2019t offset our way out of this problem. We have to come up with a way to fly sustainably, and we have to figure out a way to build our homes and source our food and make our clothing in much more efficient and sensible ways.\n\nOn the personal responsibility part of it, I do my best. I haven\u2019t owned a car in a few years. I\u2019m proud to say I have almost 4,000 miles on Citi Bikes (New York\u2019s bike-share service), but I just like riding a bike. I\u2019m not doing that to be some sort of Captain Planet statement maker; I just liked that way of getting around New York City. If I lived in Dallas or Chicago, it probably wouldn\u2019t work.\n\nPersonal choices are important because they\u2019re an extension of our awareness of the problem of what\u2019s in our air, what\u2019s in our water, what our energy mix means for life as we know it and what it will mean for generations to come.\n\nWhat everybody chooses to do with that is important, but what is hugely important is talking about it. Letting it inform your choices as a consumer and a voter for sure. But also realizing that the decision-makers who work in C-suites of the biggest petrochemical companies, the biggest fossil fuel legacy companies in the world \u2013 you could fit all of them in a couple of Greyhound buses.\n\nRight now, governments are subsidizing fossil fuel. They\u2019re paying companies to uncork the Godzilla that is changing weather in horrible ways. So until massive systems change, the best you can do as a consumer is just be aware and talk about it.\n\nWOLF: That\u2019s kind of depressing. What am I missing?\n\nWEIR: There\u2019s a couple of things that I like to point out. In 2022, if you asked the average American to guess how many of their fellow countrymen and women both understand the climate crisis and are supportive of meaningful action, the average response was 33% to 40%, regardless of party. In reality, it is like 66% to 80%.\n\nThe authors of the paper call it \u201cpluralistic ignorance.\u201d If you care about an Earth in balance, you think you\u2019re outnumbered two to one, when the opposite is true.\n\nPeople are surrounded by allies they didn\u2019t know they had. People also underestimate how quickly nature can heal itself if given a chance and how quickly systems can adjust when people work together.\n\nThe pandemic taught us a lot of lessons, but it also produced a number of vaccines in record time when everyone was focused on one mission. So there\u2019s a lot of room for despair. But there\u2019s so many reasons for hope, and it\u2019s just really about the stories we tell around this topic.",

            "text": "Income-driven repayment (IDR) plans provide relief for federal student loan borrowers by capping monthly payments based on income and family size. These plans offer a path towards loan forgiveness after 20 or 25 years of repayment, depending on the specific IDR plan in place. The recent adjustments announced by the Department of Education (ED) aim to streamline this process, ensuring that borrowers are closer to realizing forgiveness under IDR plans.\n\nThe key change introduced by ED involves a one-time adjustment that factors in various elements towards loan forgiveness, such as months spent in repayment, deferment periods, and certain forbearance periods. This adjustment provides borrowers with additional credit towards forgiveness, potentially leading to immediate qualification for forgiveness for those with loans in repayment for over 20 or 25 years.\n\nA spokesperson from the ED emphasized, \"The adjustment is automatic for most borrowers, with no fees involved. Any suggestion of payment for loan forgiveness should be treated as a scam.\" This reassurance underscores the simplicity and legitimacy of the process.\n\nFurthermore, President Joe Biden's administration has been proactive in ensuring borrowers receive relief. In November 2023, approximately 813,000 borrowers received emails notifying them of forgiven loans, marking a significant milestone in the initiative. The administration's commitment to addressing past missteps in the IDR and Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) programs reflects a dedication to easing the burden of student loan debt.\n\nIDR adjustment extends to other borrowers\n\nThe IDR account adjustment not only benefits those nearing the end of their repayment terms but also extends relief to borrowers who have faced financial challenges, including those impacted by the pandemic. It recognizes the importance of providing equitable solutions to borrowers navigating complex repayment systems.\n\nMoving forward, borrowers are encouraged to take advantage of available resources to determine their eligibility and understand the implications of these adjustments. By logging into StudentAid.gov and consulting with loan servicers, borrowers can gain clarity on their loan types and repayment histories, ensuring they make informed decisions regarding enrollment in IDR plans and potential forgiveness opportunities.\n\nUltimately, the IDR account adjustment signifies a significant step towards alleviating the financial burdens faced by millions of federal student loan borrowers, underscoring the government's commitment to promoting financial stability and opportunity for all.",

While a 2016 Washington Post review found that Trump made over $44 million, the company \u2014 Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts \u2014 lost more than $1 billion and ended up in bankruptcy.\n\nThis time around, there\u2019s at least one similarity between the two ventures separated by decades. The newly merged company that\u2019s set to go public, Trump Media, will be listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange with the letters DJT, Trump\u2019s initials. Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts used the same stock ticker when it went public with great fanfare in 1995.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going public and we\u2019re really very happy about it,\u201d Trump told reporters almost 30 years ago. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a great day.\u201d\n\nThe Atlantic City, New Jersey, company lost money every year, but its stock prices did well \u2014 for a time. In the initial public offering, the company raised $140 million, selling 10 million shares at $14 each.\n\nBy 1996, the stock reached a high of $35 a share before plummeting later that year, in part because the company bought another casino for $100 million more than its estimated $400 million value, The New York Times reported in 2016.\n\nThe company, meanwhile, kept bleeding cash. The year the stock peaked, it lost $66 million. In 1999, it lost $134 million. And in 2004 \u2014 when the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange \u2014 it lost $191 million, according to a CNBC review.\n\nA spokesman for Trump\u2019s campaign did not return a request for comment.\n\nTrump, who was the company\u2019s chairman and later CEO, continued making millions of dollars a year in salary and bonuses despite the heavy losses.\n\nThe business helped pay for aspects of his famously lavish lifestyle, including spending over $6 million to entertain guests on his plane and golf courses, according to The Washington Post report. He also used company cash to buy Trump-branded merchandise, including $1.2 million on Trump Ice bottled water, the report said.\n\nTrump\u2019s new venture is centered on his social media platform, Truth Social. Shareholders in a company called Digital World Acquisition Corp. voted Friday to approve a merger with Trump Media & Technology Group, the private firm that owns Truth Social.\n\nUnder the merged company, Trump would have nearly 80 million shares, worth around $3 billion. DWAC shares on Friday closed nearly 14% lower than their opening price.\n\nThe impending IPO comes as the presumptive GOP presidential nominee is experiencing a very public cash crunch. Earlier this month he posted a $91 million bond to pause writer E. Jean Carroll\u2019s defamation award against him while he appeals it.\n\nTrump has also been attempting to get a bond for a similar pause on New York Attorney General Letitia James\u2019 $464 million civil fraud award against him, his companies and co-defendants. His lawyers have told an appeals court that he doesn\u2019t have enough cash on hand to secure such a bond.\n\nIf he does not post a bond by Monday and an appeals court doesn\u2019t intervene, James will be authorized to start seizing his assets. Meanwhile, in a Truth Social post on Friday, Trump said, \u201cThrough hard work, talent, and luck, I currently have almost five hundred million dollars in cash, a substantial amount of which I intended to use in my campaign for president,\u201d indicating he has the means to obtain a bond.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear when exactly Trump would be able to cash in on the upcoming listing for his social media company. Under the deal\u2019s terms, Trump is prohibited from selling shares in the merged company for at least six months. But the board of directors, which will likely include his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., could vote to allow the former president to sell shares earlier than that.",

            "text": "If anyone is wondering what is the one, sole driving force behind Joe Biden\u2019s foreign policy, here is the answer: It\u2019s always been about the oil, stupid. Whether it was becoming best friends with the \u201cevil dictators\u201d in Iran and Venezuela in hopes of keeping their oil output in the market and depressing the price of the commodity, or enacting purely optical sanctions on Russian oil exports which have led to record oil exports \u2013 and export revenues \u2013 by the Putin regime, the handlers of the senile president have been terrified of any false move that sharply reduces the supply of oil or its byproducts in the global market, sending commodity prices \u2013 and inflation \u2013 surging, and crushing Biden\u2019s re-election chances.\n\nWhich brings us to the latest surreal news.\n\nRecall that in recent days, Ukraine has taken its drone attack raids deep inside Russian territory, hitting Putin where it hurts, namely bombing one Russian oil refinery after another. Now granted, Ukraine can do far worse and sink Russian oil tankers, but Kiev understands that this would spark outrage at the White House as it would instantly send oil prices surging, although once Trump is in the White House, Ukraine will have no such concerns as we pointed out earlier this week.\n\nUkraine only attacking Russian refineries with drones instead of sinking Russian tankers as that would send oil soaring and would cripple Biden re-election odds. Once Trump wins, Ukraine will go scorched earth on Russian oil infra/tankers. \u2014 zerohedge (@zerohedge) March 17, 2024\n\nHowever, after the onslaught of Ukraine attacks on Russian refineries shut down over 600,000 barrels of Russian daily refining\u2026\n\n\u2026 this morning the FT reported what our readers already knew, namely that the Biden admin is freaking out that Ukraine\u2019s drone strikes \u201crisk driving up global oil prices\u201d which is why Biden has \u201curged Ukraine to halt attacks on Russia\u2019s energy infrastructure.\u201d\n\nAnd it wasn\u2019t just once, or twice: the \u201crepeated warnings\u201d from Washington were delivered to senior officials at Ukraine\u2019s state security service, the SBU, and its military intelligence directorate, known as the GUR, sources told the Financial Times, as both intelligence units had steadily expanded their own drone programs to strike Russian targets on land, sea and in the air since the start of the Kremlin\u2019s full-scale invasion in February 2022.\n\nOne person said that the White House had grown increasingly frustrated by brazen Ukrainian drone attacks that have struck oil refineries, terminals, depots and storage facilities across western Russia, hurting its oil production capacity as we discussed previously. But what is really being hurt is America\u2019s enthusiasm to refill their car after the average gasoline price in the US soared above $3.50, the highest since October and above year-ago levels.\n\nAnd about to go higher\u2026\n\nAs the FT redundantly notes, \u201cRussia remains one of the world\u2019s most important energy exporters despite western sanctions on its oil and gas sector.\u201d Of course, the \u201cdespite\u201d here is a joke: if western sanctions really wanted to halt Russian oil exports they would; instead just like in the case of Ukraine targeting Russian oil infrastructure, \u201cvirtuous\u201d western leaders are all about \u201chelping\u201d Ukraine (of course with your money, dear taxpayers) as long as it does not interfere with their re-election chances. Which means keep any sanctions purely in the optical arena as the alternative is a sharp spike in oil prices. Indeed, oil prices have risen about 15 per cent this year, to $85 a barrel, pushing up fuel costs just as the figurehead in the White House begins his campaign for re-election.\n\nThe White House is also concerned that if Ukraine keeps hitting Russian facilities, including many that are hundreds of miles from the border, Russia could retaliate by lashing out at energy infrastructure relied on by the west. This includes the CPC pipeline carrying oil from Kazakhstan through Russia to the global market. Western companies including ExxonMobil and Chevron use the pipeline, which Moscow briefly shut in 2022.\n\n\u201cWe do not encourage or enable attacks inside of Russia,\u201d an NSC spokesperson said. The CIA declined to comment. In Kyiv, a spokesperson for the SBU declined to comment. Officials at GUR and Zelenskyy\u2019s office did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAs reported previously, Ukraine had stepped up its air attacks in recent weeks, as its drone programs expand and the ground war shifts in Moscow\u2019s favor. It also follows growing discontent in Kyiv over what is seen as the west\u2019s ambivalent approach to curbing Moscow\u2019s energy revenues. Since 2022, there have been at least 12 attacks on major Russian refineries, and at least nine this year, along with several terminals, depots and storage facilities, according to a military intelligence official in Kyiv.\n\nUkraine has steadily increased drone strikes as its technologies have advanced. Ukrainian officials claim to have developed drones with a range in excess of 1,000km and payloads capable of inflicting severe damage. Kyiv launched two of its largest and most widespread drone attacks last week, with operations by both the GUR and SBU successfully targeting seven Russian energy facilities in consecutive days.\n\nOver the past year, GRU and SBU sea drones have also struck Russian ports, destroyed several Russian warships in the Black Sea and hit Moscow\u2019s prized Crimea bridge connecting Russia to the occupied Ukrainian peninsula. The aim of the \u201cspecial operations\u201d is to hamper the supply of fuel to Russia\u2019s troops and cut funding for the Kremlin\u2019s war effort, according to one Ukrainian official involved in planning and conducting the attacks. This is something the West pretended it was doing with \u201csanctions\u201d which turned out to be anything but.\n\nHelima Croft, a former CIA analyst now at RBC Capital Markets, recently noted that Ukraine had shown it could strike most of the oil export infrastructure in western Russia, putting about 60 per cent of the country\u2019s exports at risk.\n\nAfter the Financial Times published news of the US warnings on Friday Olha Stefanishyna, Ukraine\u2019s deputy prime minister for European and Euro-Atlantic integration, was asked how Kyiv had responded to the Biden administration\u2019s appeals to stop attacks on Russian refineries.\n\nShe said: \u201cThe Ukrainian side responded, I think, precisely by achieving its goals and by very successful operations conducted on the territory of the Russian Federation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe understand the appeals of our American partners,\u201d Stefanishyna told an audience at the Kyiv Security Forum. \u201cAt the same time, we are fighting with the capabilities, resources and practices that we have today.\u201d She said energy facilities were legitimate targets from a military point of view, even as the Biden admin clearly disagreed.\n\nIn other words, a defiant Ukraine is now openly biting the hand that feeds it. Which means that Ukraine\u2019s attacks on Russian refiners is rapidly emerging as a problem that only such a legendary energy expert as Hunter Biden can solve.\n\n* * * *\n\n\u201cNothing terrifies a sitting American president more than a surge in pump prices during an election year,\u201d said Bob McNally, president of consultancy Rapidan Energy and a former White House energy adviser.\n\nHilariously, while the air campaign is also seen by some officials as a means to spur Washington into approving the $60bn military assistance package held up in Congress that is critical for Ukraine\u2019s defence, what is more likely to happen is that even Biden decides to give more funding to Ukraine which is now using US made weapons to directly reduce his re-election chances.",

            "text": "(MENAFN- The Peninsula) The Washington Post\n\nThe biden administration finalized the toughest-ever limits on planet-warming emissions from passenger cars and light trucks Wednesday, in a controversial bid to accelerate the nation's halting transition to electric vehicles.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency rule - President biden's most far-reaching climate regulation yet - would require automakers to ramp up sales of electric vehicles while slashing carbon emissions from gasoline-powered models, which account for about one-fifth of America's contribution to global warming.\n\nBut unlike last year's proposed rule, automakers would not need to dramatically boost electric vehicle (EV) sales until after 2030. The delayed timeline reflects an election-year concession to labor unions, a key Democratic constituency that has raised concerns about a rapid shift to EVs.\n\nIn another change from the proposal, automakers could comply by boosting sales of plug-in hybrid vehicles in addition to all-electric vehicles. Plug-in hybrids have recently proved more popular with U.S. consumers, in part because of concerns about a lack of public charging infrastructure.\n\nThe final rule will still prevent 7.2 billion metric tons of carbon emissions from entering the atmosphere through 2055, according to the EPA. It will also reduce fine particulate matter and nitrogen oxides, preventing up to 2,500 premature deaths from air pollution annually starting in 2055, the agency said.\n\n\"Our final rule delivers the same - if not more - pollution reduction than we set out at proposal,\u201d EPA Administrator Michael Regan said on a call with reporters Tuesday previewing the announcement. \"These final standards will also reduce some of the most serious pollutants that impact public health.\u201d\n\nRepublican-led states and fossil fuel companies are likely to challenge the rule in court the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade group whose members include Ford, General Motors, Stellantis and Toyota, praised the EPA's decision to delay the stricter EV requirements until after 2030.\n\n\"Moderating the pace of EV adoption in 2027, 2028, 2029 and 2030 was the right call,\u201d John Bozzella, president and CEO of the alliance, said in a statement. \"... These adjusted EV targets - still a stretch goal - should give the market and supply chains a chance to catch up.\u201d\n\nU.S. EV sales have cooled in recent months. According to estimates from Kelley Blue Book, U.S. EV sales increased year-over-year by 40 percent in the fourth quarter of 2023, down from a 49 percent jump in the third quarter and a 52 percent spike in the second quarter.\n\n\"The EV market in the U.S. is still growing, but not growing as fast,\u201d analysts with Kelley Blue Book wrote.\n\nYet Albert Gore, the executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association and the son of former vice president Al Gore, said other figures paint a more encouraging picture. He noted that a record 1.2 million EVs were sold in the United States last year, bringing EVs' market share to 7.6 percent in 2023 compared with 5.9 percent in 2022.\n\n\"Whether or not we're talking about a real slowdown, the trend line for EVs has been one of phenomenal growth over the last couple of years,\u201d Gore said.\n\nThe price of EVs is also plunging so fast that they're now almost as cheap as gas-powered cars. The average price difference last month was $5,000, according to data from Cox Automotive.\n\nStill, the recent sales slowdown has prompted some automakers to scale back their EV plans, with Ford slashing production of the much-touted F-150 Lightning electric pickup truck. Many automakers are now pivoting to better-selling plug-in hybrids - a compromise between the internal combustion engines of the past and the batteries of the future.\n\nWednesday's rule comes after a contentious back-and-forth between the United Auto Workers and the biden administration over whether - and how - the shift to EVs will benefit workers.\n\nIn September, the UAW launched a historic strike against Detroit's three biggest automakers - Ford, General Motors and Stellantis. The workers warned that the rise of EVs could erase well-paying jobs in the auto industry, since many EV plants are being built in Southern states less friendly to union labor.\n\nDespite these warnings, the EPA issued an ambitious proposed rule last Aprilthat called for EVs to account for 67 percent of all new passenger car and light-duty truck sales by 2032.\n\nWeeks later, UAW President Shawn Fain wrote that the union was withholding its endorsement of biden's reelection campaign over \"concerns with the electric vehicle transition.\u201d\n\nYet the union reversed course and coalesced around biden after the EPA signaled it would relax the timeline in the final rule. The UAW endorsed the president at its annual legislative conference in January, and Fain attended biden's State of the Union address this month.\n\nAutomakers could still comply with the final rule by making EVs account for 67 percent of new car sales in 2032, according to the EPA. But they could also meet the requirements by making all-electric vehicles account for 56 percent and making plug-in hybrids represent 13 percent, the agency said.\n\nFormer president Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has called Fain a \"dope\u201d and has repeatedly bashed biden's EV goals. He has falsely claimed that EVs cannot travel far on a single charge, and he has pledged to scrap the EPA rule on day two of a second term.\n\nOn Monday, Trump sought to defend his declaration over the weekend that there would be a \"bloodbath\u201d if he lost in November, claiming he was merely describing a bloodbath for the auto sector. He wrote on his social media platform that he was \"simply referring to [EV] imports\u201d allowed by biden, which he said\"are killing the automobile industry.\u201d\n\nManish Bapna, president and CEO of NRDC Action Fund, the political arm of the Natural Resources Defense Council, criticized Trump's anti-EV rhetoric.\n\n\"The industry is betting its future on electric cars, drivers are buying them in record numbers and last fall's UAW agreement makes sure workers benefit,\u201d Bapna said in an email. \"biden's got a strategy to support that shift. Trump wants to slam it into reverse.\u201d\n\nThe fossil fuel industry has sought to drum up opposition to the EPA rule, which could eat into demand for its petroleum products. The American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM), an industry trade group, has launched a seven-figure campaign against what it calls a de facto \"gas car ban.\u201d The campaign includes ads in battleground states warning that the rule will restrict consumer choice.\n\n\"To be sure, the administration refers to these regulations as 'standards,' not 'bans' or 'mandates,'\u201d AFPM President and CEO Chet Thompson said on a call with reporters this month. \"But they do that because they know how unpopular bans are with Americans.\u201d\n\nThe AFPM'smembers include fossil fuel giants such as ExxonMobil, Chevron, Marathon Petroleum and Valero Energy. Marathon Petroleum, the nation's largest refiner, waged a covert campaign in 2018 to roll back the car emissions standards set by President Barack Obama.\n\nThe American Petroleum Institute, the oil industry's top lobbying arm, teased plans to sue over the standards set by the biden administration.\n\n\"We'll do everything we can to stop the rule,\u201d Mike Sommers, chief executive of the institute, said in an interview Wednesday at an energy conference in Houston.\n\nAlthough the EPA rule would not, in fact, ban internal combustion engine vehicles, California regulators are seeking to end statewide sales of new gas cars by 2035. In the past, more than a dozen other states have opted to follow California's tougher tailpipe pollution rules.\n\nThe California Air Resources Board announced Tuesday a deal with Stellantis, the owner of the Jeep and Ram brands. Under the deal, Stellantis agreed to comply with California's EV sales requirements even if they are blocked by a court or a potential second Trump administration.\n\nThe automaker had previously blasted those requirements for handing rivals an unfair advantage. But on Tuesday, Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares called the agreement a \"win-win solution\u201d that will avoid 10 million to 12 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions through 2030.\n\n\"The biggest and most influential companies in the world understand that this is how we can fight climate change together,\u201d California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) said in a statement",

            "text": "Biden Administration\u2019s Electric Vehicle Regulations Spark Debate and Uncertainty\n\nIn a move that could have significant implications for American consumers, the Biden administration has unveiled new regulations aimed at promoting clean vehicles. The Environmental Protection Agency claims these regulations will enhance consumer choice in clean vehicles, but critics argue that they will actually limit options and push Americans towards costly and less reliable electric vehicles. The EPA\u2019s ambitious goal of having plug-in electric vehicles make up the majority of the automotive market overlooks the fact that consumers have been slow to adopt EVs due to concerns about range, refueling times, and high costs. Despite substantial subsidies, electric vehicles accounted for only 7.6% of vehicle sales in 2023, with the average cost of owning an EV over five years exceeding $92,000 compared to $76,500 for a gas-powered vehicle.\n\nFurthermore, the lack of widespread charging infrastructure poses a significant challenge for EV users, with many chargers being slow and unreliable. Issues with charging availability and functionality have further dampened consumer enthusiasm for electric vehicles, leading some automakers to scale back their EV production plans in response to shifting market demands. The economic impact of these regulations extends beyond individual consumers, as taxpayers are also on the hook for subsidizing new production facilities for electric vehicles. In Michigan, for example, lawmakers have pledged $200 million in taxpayer money for just one Ford battery plant.\n\nAs the debate over the Biden administration\u2019s push towards electric vehicles continues, it is clear that the transition away from gas-powered cars will not be without its challenges and costs. Critics warn that the administration\u2019s focus on EVs could ultimately limit consumer choice, drive up prices, and burden taxpayers with the cost of subsidizing the shift to electric vehicles. The road ahead for the automotive industry and American consumers is likely to be paved with uncertainty as the push towards clean vehicles gathers momentum.\n\n#CleanVehicles #EVTransition #ChargingInfrastructure #ConsumerChoice #EVDebate #EnvironmentalRegulations\n\nLinks to article:",

If I were betting on it, I would bet Trump would win.\u201d\n\nNorth Carolina is part of the Biden campaign\u2019s pathway-to-270 strategy through critical swing states, which include the so-called blue wall made up of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin; western battlegrounds including Nevada and Arizona; and southern states such as Georgia and North Carolina.\n\nNorth Carolina is included as part of a $30 million six-week advertising blitz the campaign announced after the State of the Union address to spend big in battleground states. Biden recently did radio interviews around Super Tuesday in Fayetteville and Charlotte to reach Black North Carolinians, one of several voting factions key to another victory.\n\nBiden and Vice President Harris will travel to North Carolina on March 26 as part of their effort to travel to every battleground state in March.\n\n\u201cNorth Carolinians know that while President Biden is fighting for us, Donald Trump is fighting for billionaires, corporations, and an extreme agenda that hurts our families and our economy,\u201d Biden campaign\u2019s North Carolina communications director Dory MacMillan told The Hill. \u201cOur campaign will continue to communicate across every corner of this state to reject Trump\u2019s attacks on our families and earn four more years of progress with President Biden.\u201d\n\nThe campaign currently has a $155 million war chest, but aside from spending and infrastructure, a major factor that strategists say can help Biden in the Tar Heel State is the governor\u2019s race, which includes far-right Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson on the ballot.\n\n\u201cGiven the very weak Republican gubernatorial candidate in North Carolina and a very sophisticated operation from the Democratic candidate, the Biden team will have an even better opportunity to win there this time around because of the demographic shifts and a robust coordinated campaign in a state he barely lost,\u201d said Michael LaRosa, first lady Jill Biden\u2019s traveling press secretary during the 2020 campaign.\n\nMike Lonergan, the communications director for Mark Robinson for Governor, criticized Biden and Robinson\u2019s Democratic opponent Josh Stein in a statement to The Hill, saying Stein \u201cstands with President Biden\u2019s open-borders policies and would turn North Carolina into a sanctuary state for illegal immigrants; and he\u2019s backed by far-left radicals that want to defund the police.\u201d\n\nThe statement continued, \u201cThe Democrats will stop at nothing to smear Mark Robinson because they know North Carolina voters have had enough of extremism and lies from career politicians like Joe Biden and Josh Stein.\u201d\n\nTrump barely beat Biden in North Carolina last time around by less than 1 percentage point. The last Democrat to win the state in a presidential contest was then-Democratic nominee Barack Obama, but he lost his reelection bid there to 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney by 2 percentage points. Trump won the state when he ran for the White House the first time in 2016, beating Hillary Clinton by nearly 4 points.\n\nAn aggregation of polls shows Trump with a 7.4 point lead over Biden in North Carolina, a wider lead than the former president has managed in other battleground states.\n\n2024 could prove to be a split-ticket situation in North Carolina, where Democratic gubernatorial nominee Josh Stein wins while Trump takes the state, considering that when Trump won the state in 2020, Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper was reelected to a second term.\n\nThe GOP nominee for superintendent, who would oversee the public schools in North Carolina, is also troubling to some moderate Republicans. Social media posts have emerged of Michele Morrow calling for former President Obama to be publicly executed, CNN reported.\n\nGiven the slate of Republican candidates, Democrats believe pouring efforts into North Carolina is a good idea.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a smart bet,\u201d said Ivan Zapien, former official at the Democratic National Committee. \u201cThe Republicans have nominated some down-ballot candidates that are not going to do well in the suburbs, assuming the suburbs perform like they have been performing [in] the last cycles. It\u2019s ripe for a pickup.\u201d\n\nStill, Democrats acknowledge it\u2019s an uphill battle.\n\n\u201cNorth Carolina is ripe to flip, but it\u2019s still North Carolina,\u201d LaRosa said.\n\nRepublicans like Heye, a North Carolina native, say the state\u2019s not a forgone conclusion given its demographic developments.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an outside chance that the Democrats take it because of the closeness of the state, because of the fast growth in the state, particularly in two parts \u2014 Charlotte and Raleigh and their suburban areas,\u201d he said.\n\nGrowth in areas like Charlotte and Raleigh has comprised an uptick in young, professional, suburban women, who helped give Democrats better-than-expected results in 2022 after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.\n\nBlack voters are also a pivotal voting bloc in North Carolina, which is home to 11 historically Black colleges and universities.\n\nJim Kessler, executive vice president for policy at Third Way, compared North Carolina to Georgia, a state that helped push Biden over the edge in 2020 in large part because of support from Black voters.\n\n\u201cThey each have a growing share of college-educated voters that have become essential for Democrats. Georgia has more African American voters, which proved to be the difference in 2020, but North Carolina is starting to look like the kind of state where Democrats should prevail,\u201d he said.\n\nThis story was updated at 8:57 p.m.\n\nFOLLOW US ON GOOGLE NEWS\n\nRead original article here",

            "text": "With Donald Trump leading in many of the polls for the upcoming US presidential election, his comments about global security and foreign policy have to be taken seriously.\n\nIn February, Trump flippantly remarked that he would encourage Russia to do whatever it wanted to NATO states that failed to pay their bills. In a follow-up interview on GB News this week he warned allies \u201cnot to take advantage\u201d of the US.\n\nNowhere is this causing more concern than for the countries in the Baltic states \u2013 Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.\n\nNot only does Trump, sometimes, say he wants to halt all US military aid to Ukraine, but Trump wants to undercut article 5 of Nato\u2019s treaty \u2013 the principle of collective defence \u2013 something that has become increasingly important in the wake of Russia\u2019s aggression. British military sources are worried that Trump\u2019s remarks will strengthen Putin\u2019s resolve over Ukraine, and could result in him advancing on even more territory.\n\nEven before Trump emerged on the US political scene, the Baltic countries have been especially concerned about Russia\u2019s growing ambitions. They have, after all, been invaded and occupied by Russia before, in 1940, and then forced to become part of the Soviet Union. There\u2019s plenty of people who can still remember life in the Soviet Union.\n\nSince Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea in 2014, the Baltic states have been the loudest voices sounding the alarm about the existential threat posed by Russia, and all three countries increased their military spending to more than 2 per cent of their GDP, and recently agreed to raise it to 3 per cent.\n\nAmid growing security concerns, the defence ministers in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia also agreed in January to set up a common Baltic defence zone on their borders with Russia and Belarus. This would consist of building physical defensive structures such as bunkers.\n\nEstonia will begin construction of 600 bunkers in early 2025. The nations will also cooperate in developing missile artillery, and ensuring that their equipment, ammunition and manpower is updated.\n\nEstonia has also doubled the size of its territorial defence force to 20,000 people, while Latvia reintroduced conscription in 2023 after becoming the only Baltic state to stop mandatory military service in 2006. Latvia also plans to double the size of its armed forces to 61,000 by the year 2032. Meanwhile, Lithuania has made an agreement with Germany to allow a permanent brigade of 4,800 of its troops to be combat ready on the Russian border by 2027.\n\nBut given that Russia borders 14 countries, why are the Baltic states especially concerned about their security? In addition to being geographically close, a notable number of ethnic Russians live in the Baltic countries (5per cent in Lithuania; 25per cent in Estonia and 36per cent in Latvia. In the eastern Estonian city of Narva, 95.7per cent of the population are native Russian speakers and 87.7per cent are ethnic Russians.\n\nThis matters as Putin has argued that having substantial numbers of ethnic Russians living outside of Russia, due to the \u201ccatastrophic\u201d dissolution of the Soviet Union, represents a \u201chumanitarian disaster of epic proportions\u201d as it left Russians cut off from \u201ctheir motherland\u201d. Putin has vowed to actively protect all \u201cRussians\u201d living abroad. In particular, Putin has said he was concerned about how ethnic Russians are being treated in the Baltics, remarking that the deportation of ethnic Russians (most notably in Latvia where there have been recent changes to its immigration laws), poses a threat to Russian national security.\n\nThe Kremlin has also protested the demolition of Soviet monuments in the Baltics, placing Estonia\u2019s prime minster, Kaja Kallas, on its wanted list for doing so. But these claims about wanting to protect Russians abroad, are really just a pretext to justify escalation with the Baltics, which will test Nato\u2019s alliance and destabilise the organisation. So it\u2019s not just important that there are ethnic Russians living there \u2013 there are strategic reasons as well that make them an easy target.\n\nEven with the Baltic countries strengthening their troop numbers, Russia currently has 1.32 million active military personnel, and two million active reserve. Combined this is greater that Lithuania\u2019s entire population of 2.8 million people, and far greater than Estonia and Latvia which have populations of 1.3 million and 1.8 million people, respectively. For Lithuania, which borders Belarus and Russian-run mini-state Kaliningrad, there are concerns that it could be taken over first by Russian forces, which would then physically isolate Lithuania from the rest of the Baltics. The Kaliningrad region has become increasingly militarised in recent years, with Iskander ballistic missiles and S-400 systems installed. With Trump suggesting he would weaken the US\u2019s commitment to Nato if elected, there won\u2019t be much of a deterrent for Putin to grab low-hanging fruit.\n\nThe current Nato response force consists of approximately 40,000 troops, with plans to upgrade to 300,000 troops. But quick-reaction units could still be too slow to protect the Baltics from Russian forces as, ironically, moving large units, vehicles and ammunition across borders is bureaucratic and takes time. It would be important to have excellent intelligence and to move quickly, something that will be made more difficult with the US potentially opting out of its commitments.\n\nThough Russia has plunged much of its resources into winning the Ukraine war, Putin still aims to expand Russian sovereignty across the post-Soviet states and to effectively dismantle Nato, something that Trump takes no issue with. As Russia has been ramping up its war machine, the Baltic states firmly believe that Russian aggression will not stop at Ukraine, and that they could be next.\n\nAlso Read: AAP Leader Gopal Rai Announces Protest Against Arvind Kejriwal\u2019s Arrest, Calls for Countrywide Action",

            "text": "PALM BEACH, Florida \u2014 Former President Donald Trump told Breitbart News exclusively last week that he sees a new category of crime emerging in the United States because of President Joe Biden and his fellow Democrats\u2019 policies: \u201cMigrant crime.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a new form of crime in the United States\u2014it\u2019s called \u2018migrant crime,\u2019\u201d Trump told Breitbart News in a 90-minute exclusive interview at Mar-a-Lago last Wednesday. \u201cNow, it would be called and normally I would call it \u2018Biden migrant crime,\u2019 but that\u2019s too long and too crazy. But everyone knows we have a new category in crime. So we have crime, and we have migrant crime. It\u2019s vicious and it\u2019s horrible and these people are very tough. Everyone talks about the migrants coming to America; many of these people are real bad people. Many of them are sick. Many of them are mentally ill.\u201d\n\nTrump has made focusing on the plight of \u201cAngel Families,\u201d like the family of murdered 22-year-old Georgia nursing student Laken Riley, a key facet of his campaign to return to the White House. Sadly, Riley is hardly the only instance of Americans being killed by migrants in the country unlawfully and people who would not be otherwise hurt if the government enforced American immigration laws.\n\nTrump Campaign/Kyle Mazza/Anadolu via Getty Images\n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign, as Breitbart News reported exclusively before his and Biden\u2019s rivaling border trips a few weeks ago, released a brutal video highlighting many of the crimes, including rapes and murders, that migrants Biden let into the country have committed. Trump also, at his recent Georgia rally immediately after becoming the last remaining GOP presidential candidate and right before he locked up a majority of the delegates to the Republican National Convention this year, met with Riley\u2019s parents. He also intends to do more events and meetings throughout the year with Angel Families.\n\nTrump told Breitbart News that a big part of what\u2019s going wrong in Biden\u2019s America is that many of the migrants that Biden is letting into the country are bad criminals from Central American countries. He noted that crime is actually down in Venezuela, which he says is because Venezuela sent its criminals here to the United States.\n\n\u201cThe amazing thing about the border to me is I used to think, \u2018Who wants an open border where the world is coming into your country?\u2019\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt makes sense\u2014I don\u2019t know if you saw that it\u2019s 61 percent down in crime in Venezuela. So Venezuela, all their gangs are not even just coming up. They\u2019re being bussed right to our border and they\u2019re being forced in at gunpoint. We\u2019ve got these Venezuelan gangs, who are very tough gangs\u2014they make our gangs look like very nice people\u2014they\u2019re now migrants. I\u2019ve watched cops get roughed up over the years and watched them get shot in cars, but what I\u2019ve never watched is cops having fistfights in the middle of the street. They\u2019re duking it out. They\u2019re literally fighting these kids. I\u2019ve never seen that before. In their country, they\u2019d be dead immediately if that ever happened.\u201d\n\nHe also said that the crush of migrants into the country is severely hurting big cities like his previous home, New York City.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s amazing to me is I\u2019ve always heard how New York and all these other places don\u2019t have any money, but all of a sudden they\u2019re getting billions and billions of dollars to take care of this problem,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey have, I guess, 500,000 migrants in New York right? By the way, these are some tough people.\u201d",

It seems it was no coincidence that former White House press secretary Jen Psaki used a CCDH report, the \u201cDisinformation Dozen,\u201d to insist on increased COVID-19 censorship in July 2021.\n\nBiden\u2019s \u201cNational Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism\u201d endorsed the anti-free speech Christchurch Call to Action and turned to research conducted by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) like the CCDH, the initially UK-based group that is now also incorporated in America, AFL explained. CCDH calls itself a \u201cnot-for-profit\u201d NGO that \u201cworks to stop the spread of online hate and disinformation.\u201d Leftist British politician Imran Ahmed is the CEO. As a Labor Party staffer, Ahmed reportedly coordinated with leftist outlet The Guardian to accuse UK Conservative Party figure Grant Shapps falsely of editing his Tory rivals\u2019 Wikipedia pages, according to Twitter Files journalist Matt Taibbi.\n\nAfter CCDH released the \u201cDisinformation Dozen\u201d report, the Biden White House used it to urge Big Tech companies, especially Facebook, to deplatform the highlighted COVID-19 vaccine critics.\n\nThe co-chair of the now-defunct Disinformation Governance Board (DGB), Department of Homeland Security (DHS) under secretary Robert Silvers, also took an interest in the organization. Silvers messaged Eva Hartshorn-Sanders, who at the time was CCDH\u2019s Head of Policy, to arrange a meeting to discuss the organization\u2019s work, AFL noted. He was then invited to CCDH\u2019s Global Summit by Hartshorn-Sanders, who has pushed anti-free speech legislation.\n\nBut the Biden administration\u2019s ties to CCDH do not end there. CCDH also met with Biden officials after the White House Task Force to Address Online Harassment and Abuse debuted, per AFL. CCDH submitted recommendations to the task force on addressing \u201cgender-based violence.\u201d When the White House released a 2023 blueprint on \u201cOnline Harassment and Abuse,\u201d Hartshorn-Sanders claimed credit for policy development.\n\nTwitter Files journalist Michael Shellenberger slammed the government censorship collusion revealed by AFL. He accused CCDH of \u201chyp[ing] hate\u201d to \u201cdemand Facebook and other social media platforms to remove content and people they don\u2019t like.\u201d He added, \u201cFor the government to decide what is extreme is a way of labeling someone as a potential terrorist threat.\u201d Ultimately, Shellenberger argued, \u201cThere is no reliable connection between people\u2019s beliefs and violence. Attempting to stop violence by censoring speech is totalitarian and Orwellian. It effectively criminalizes speech and creates a whole new category of pre-crime.\u201d\n\nConservatives are under attack.

            "text": "Maria Korneeva | Moment | Getty Images\n\nThe Biden administration has set a key deadline for student loan borrowers hoping to get forgiveness. Those with multiple federal student loans who request a consolidation by April 30 \u2014 which will leave them with one, larger loan \u2014 could benefit from the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s overhaul of income-driven repayment plans. Those changes have already led to debt cancelation for more than 930,000 people and $45 billion in relief. \u201cThe opportunity to consolidate loans will help many more borrowers to qualify for student loan forgiveness,\u201d said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. Here\u2019s what to know about the deadline.\n\nConsolidation can get you closer to loan forgiveness\n\nIncome-driven repayment plans, which date to 1994, set borrowers\u2019 monthly payments based on a share of their discretionary income. Those payments are typically lower than under standard repayment, and can be zero under some plans. Borrowers typically get any remaining debt forgiven after 10, 20 or 25 years, depending on the plan. One complicating factor for borrowers in these programs is that they often have multiple loans, taken out at different times, Kantrowitz said. \u201cThey get at least one new loan each year in school, on average,\u201d he said. That can mean a borrower has multiple timelines to forgiveness, one for each of those loans. More from Personal Finance:\n\nFAFSA fiasco may cause drop in college enrollment, experts say\n\nHarvard is back on top as the ultimate \u2018dream\u2019 school\n\nMore of the nation\u2019s top colleges roll out no-loan policies Now, the Biden administration is temporarily offering borrowers the chance to combine their loans and to get credit going back as far as their first loan payment on the oldest of their original loans in that bundle. For example, say a borrower graduated from college in 2004, took out more loans for a graduate degree in 2018 and is now in repayment under an income-driven plan with a 20-year timeline to forgiveness. Consolidating could lead them to immediately qualify for forgiveness on all of those loans, experts say. In normal times, consolidating your student loans can be a terrible move for those hoping to get rid of their debt as your forgiveness timeline is restarted. But the Biden administration has changed that program detail through April 30.\n\nWhat to know about consolidating your student loans\n\nAll federal student loans are eligible for consolidation, including Federal Family Education Loans, Parent Plus loans and Perkins Loans, Kantrowitz said. You can apply for a Direct Consolidation Loan at StudentAid.gov or with your loan servicer. \u201cSo long as the application is submitted by April 30, they should be fine, even if the servicers takes longer to process it,\u201d Kantrowitz said.\n\nSome borrowers who took out small amounts may even be eligible for cancelation after as few as 10 years\u2019 worth of payments, if they enroll in the new income-driven repayment option, known as the SAVE plan. Consolidating your loans shouldn\u2019t increase your monthly payment, since your bill under an income-driven repayment plan is based on your earnings and not your total debt, Kantrowitz said. Your new interest rate will be a weighted average of the rates across your loans.",

They do not work as consultants. Or lawyers. Or advisors. The Bidens don\u2019t sell a product or a service or a set of skills,\" Comer will say, according to excerpts of his opening statement obtained by Fox News Digital. \"The Bidens sell Joe Biden.\n\nComer will say that Joe Biden \"has taken action after action to further his family\u2019s plans to get rich.\"\n\n\"The scam is simple.

The Biden family promises Joe\u2019s power, Joe Biden shows up, and millions of dollars come into the Bidens\u2019 pockets.\"\n\nComer will add: \"Joe Biden is the Biden family\u2019s closer.\"\n\nTony Bobulinski, a U.S. Navy veteran, will appear publicly for a joint hearing of the House Oversight and Judiciary committees Wednesday morning.\n\nJason Galanis, who is serving a 14-year prison sentence, will also testify but will do so virtually from Federal Prison Camp, a minimum-security prison for male inmates in Montgomery, Alabama.\n\nHUNTER BIDEN REFUSES TO ATTEND HOUSE HEARING WITH FORMER BUSINESS ASSOCIATES\n\nDemocrats have invited Lev Parnas, a former associate of former Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani, to testify publicly as well.\n\nIn announcing the hearing earlier this month, Comer invited Hunter Biden to testify publicly as well, per the first son\u2019s repeated requests. Through his attorney Abbe Lowell, Hunter rejected the invitation.\n\nLowell, in a letter to the committees, called the hearing a \"carnival side show.\"\n\nComer also invited Hunter Biden\u2019s former associate, Devon Archer. Archer is not expected to attend.\n\nComer, though, has said he has \"called Hunter Biden's bluff.\"\n\nHUNTER BIDEN ADMITS HE PUT HIS FATHER ON SPEAKERPHONE, INVITED HIM TO MEETINGS, BUT DENIES 'INVOLVEMENT'\n\n\"Hunter Biden for months stated he wanted a public hearing, but now that one has been offered alongside his business associates that he worked with for years, he is refusing to come,\" Comer said. \"During our deposition and interview phase of our investigation, Hunter Biden confirmed key evidence, including evidence that his father, President Joe Biden, lied to the American people about his family\u2019s business dealings and, in fact, attended meetings, spoke on speakerphone and had coffee with his foreign business associates who collectively funneled millions to the Bidens.\"\n\nComer had subpoenaed Hunter Biden for a deposition scheduled for early December, but the president's son defied that subpoena for a closed-door deposition, demanding a public hearing instead. Comer vowed to give Hunter Biden that public hearing after the committee had him for a deposition \u2014 like all other witnesses.\n\n\"When you're investigating a family for this level of corruption you deserve the truth, the American people deserve the truth,\" Comer said. \"We're giving Hunter Biden a venue to testify publicly.\"\n\nHunter Biden appeared for his highly anticipated deposition last month before both the House Oversight and Judiciary committees and maintained that his father was never involved in and never benefited from his businesses.\n\nThe committee also heard testimony from James Biden, the president\u2019s younger brother, who testified the same.\n\nJOE BIDEN ALLEGEDLY CONSIDERED JOINING BOARD OF CCP-LINKED COMPANY, WITNESS TESTIFIES FROM PRISON\n\nHunter Biden did admit, however, that he put his father on speakerphone with his business associates and invited him to drop by his business lunches.\n\nArcher testified before the House Oversight Committee last year that Hunter Biden put his father on speakerphone at least 20 times with business associates.\n\nWithout Hunter and Archer, the hearing Wednesday will feature testimony from Bobulinski, who worked with Hunter Biden to create the joint venture SinoHawk Holdings with Chinese energy company CEFC. Bobulinski testified behind closed doors that he personally met with Joe Biden in 2017 for more than 45 minutes.\n\nBobulinski also testified that Joe Biden \"enabled\" his son Hunter to sell access to the \"most dangerous adversaries\" of the U.S., including the Chinese Communist Party, Russia and others.\n\nJOE BIDEN 'ENABLED' FAMILY TO SELL ACCESS TO 'DANGEROUS ADVERSARIES,' TONY BOBULINSKI TESTIFIES\n\nGalanis\u2019 testimony will also focus on whether Joe Biden was involved in the businesses he worked on with Hunter Biden.\n\nGalanis, who was interviewed by congressional investigators in prison last month, testified that Joe Biden was considering joining the board of a joint venture created by Hunter Biden and his business associates with ties to the Chinese Communist Party after he left the vice presidency.\n\nGalanis also said that the words \"lean in\" were \"used often by Devon and Hunter in our business dealings as a term for access to Vice President Biden\u2019s political influence.\"\n\nERIC SCHWERIN CONFIRMS JOE BIDEN USED 'ROBINWARE456' EMAIL ALIAS WHILE SERVING AS VICE PRESIDENT\n\nGalanis is serving a 14-year prison sentence after pleading guilty to securities fraud based on bonds issued by a company affiliated with a Native American tribe in South Dakota.

Trump said we now have \u201cmigrant crime\u201d to describe crimes committed by the illegal aliens allowed into the country by the Biden administration.\n\nSince 2021, nearly 8 million aliens have been welcomed into the country. Biden has provided these migrants with tickets to all corners of the U.S. His administration has fought Texas and other states that are trying to stop the invasion.\n\nMeanwhile, many of these migrants\u2014according to Trump\u2014are criminals and \u201cmentally ill.\u201d They are committing crimes against American citizens. In many cases, they are taking lives. The death of Georgia college student Laken Riley is just one example of this.\n\nOn top of that, many thousands are dying thanks to the drugs pouring over the border. Democrats and Biden are not acknowledging the smuggling operations that are bringing in deadly drugs. Nor are they willing to admit that their border policies are hurting American citizens.\n\nWe likely haven\u2019t heard the last of this term, \u201cmigrant crime.\u201d Trump will be using often, to condemn Biden\u2019s presidency.\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\nTrump coined a new term to describe crimes committed by Biden\u2019s migrants, \u201cmigrant crime.\u201d\n\nThis comes as Biden lets in millions of illegal aliens, some of whom are criminals.\n\nBiden has apparently ignored the border crisis and is working to encourage more illegal immigration.\n\nSource: Breitbart",

            "text": "Donald Trump\n\nFour years after the Covid pandemic sent America into a standstill, President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign is looking to co-opt a common question posed by former Presidentand his allies: \u201cAre you better off than you were four years ago?\u201d\n\nTrump asked his 6.7 million followers on Truth Social that question earlier this week, using it to drive contrasts between Biden and Trump\u2019s records on the economy and the border. But the Biden-Harris campaign plans to highlight key moments from four years ago in an effort to flip the question back onto Trump, seeing a golden opportunity to exploit his handling of the pandemic.\n\nThe Biden campaign made a statement Friday morning highlighting Trump\u2019s pledge four years ago to the day to \u201cterminate\u201d the Affordable Care Act, roughly 10 days after the World Health Organization formally declared Covid a global pandemic.\n\n\u201cFour years ago today, Trump was trying to throw millions of Americans off their insurance while Americans were dying by the thousands of Covid-19, even more Americans were infected, and hospitals were reaching a breaking point,\u201d Biden-Harris senior spokesperson Sarafina Chitika said in a statement.\n\nOn Thursday, the campaign released a digital ad that paired images from the early days of the pandemic with audio of Trump suggesting disinfectant as a treatment, downplaying concerns over the number of Covid-related deaths at the time, and dismissing questions from reporters about his handling of the crisis.\n\nAnd Biden is test-driving the strategy on the stump while speaking at fundraisers in Texas.\n\n\u201cJust a few days ago, he asked the famous question, \u2018Are you better off today than you were yesterday?\u2019 Well, Donald, I\u2019m glad you asked that question,\u201d Biden said during a campaign reception in Houston on Thursday. (The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nBiden pointed to Trump\u2019s handling of the pandemic and a debunked claim that Trump suggested the injection of bleach as a treatment option.\n\n\u201cHe must\u2019ve done it,\u201d Biden joked.\n\nIt comes amid a broader effort by Biden and his campaign to co-opt language made popular by Trump and the Republicans.\n\nIn a bid to highlight that Biden held more campaign events this month than Trump, Biden\u2019s campaign accused the former president of \u201chiding in his basement\u201d \u2014 a line Trump and his allies frequently deployed about Biden in 2020.\n\nThe campaign has also turned \u201cBrandon\u201d \u2014 a code word used by Republicans to insult Biden \u2014 into a kind of internet alter-ego and a core component of his social media branding, launching a \u201cDark Brandon\u201d account on X and releasing several \u201cDark Brandon\u201d-branded memes.\n\nA senior Biden-Harris campaign official told NBC News the campaign will continue to highlight \u201ckey moments from four years ago throughout the month of April.\u201d\n\nThose moments will include headlines reminding voters of rising crime and toilet paper shortages toward the end of Trump\u2019s term and footage reminding voters of the \u201cchaos\u201d of the pandemic in 2020.\n\n\u201cAmericans remember March Madness, proms, weddings, and celebrations being canceled, waiting in line for toilet paper and essentials, businesses shutting down, and losing loved ones \u2014 all because Trump failed to prepare for and then couldn\u2019t lead when we needed him the most,\u201d Biden campaign spokesperson Ammar Moussa said. \u201cThe only thing to happen four years ago to make Americans\u2019 lives better was Donald Trump losing to Joe Biden.\u201d\n\nThis article was originally published on NBCNews.com",

Biden meanwhile spent $6.3 million in the month but Trump spent more \u2014 $7.8 million.\n\nThose figures however don\u2019t show the complete picture for either candidate as filings from their various fundraising committees won\u2019t be made until April.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign said at the weekend that it had raised more than $53 million in February, leaving it with a \u201chistoric\u201d total of $155 million, which it said was the most by any Democrat at this stage in the election cycle.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Dumpster fire\u2019 \u2013\n\nPerhaps the most worrying element for Trump are his giant legal fees, as he faces criminal cases including for trying to subvert his 2020 election loss and keeping secret documents.\n\nLawyers\u2019 bills accounted for a huge $5.6 million of the money spent in February by Trump\u2019s Save America political action committee \u2014 money that could otherwise be going towards campaigning and TV spots.\n\nThe figures add to Trump\u2019s woes as he struggles to raise a $464 million bond to appeal a fine by a New York court for fraudulently inflating his wealth.\n\nThe 77-year-old now faces having his assets seized in a humiliating blow to his carefully cultivated image as a dealmaker and self-made tycoon.\n\nTrump cast the fraud case as a \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d seeking as he often does to use the legal cases against him to whip up his supporters \u2014 and get them to open their wallets.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m calling on ONE MILLION Pro-Trump patriots to chip in and say: STOP THE WITCH HUNT AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP!\u201d a campaign message on Wednesday said.\n\nThe message was titled \u201cKEEP YOUR FILTHY HANDS OFF TRUMP TOWER,\u201d his flagship New York property that could be at risk from the court case.\n\nEarlier this month Trump managed to put together a separate bond for $91.6 million as he appeals a sexual assault and defamation judgment in a lawsuit brought by New York writer E. Jean Carroll.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign described Trump\u2019s finances as a \u201cdumpster fire.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s filings paint a bleak picture for Republicans,\u201d Biden campaign spokesman Ammar Moussa wrote on Thursday.\n\nBut with a tight election looming and Trump leading Biden in key swing states in recent polls, Democrats will be trying to keep their war chest as full as possible.\n\nBiden will be joined at a fundraiser in New York on March 28 by Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, the first event of its kind to feature three Democratic presidents and among the most lucrative in party history.\n\nThe gala show is set to raise $10 million for Biden\u2019s campaign, with guests having to fork out $100,000 each to pose in a photo with the 42nd, 44th and 46th US presidents, NBC News reported.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

His efforts to negate progressive climate change policies were evident in his first term, when he pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement, rolled back environmental regulation, and relaxed regulations on oil and gas drilling. According to Trump\u2019s allies and advisors, a second term for Trump would mean even more extreme environmental policies. While efforts to fight climate change are stronger now than when Trump first attacked them, he can still do substantial damage.\n\nTrump has said that should he become president again, boosting fossil fuels would be one of his top priorities. Trump\u2019s allies have said that Trump plans to drive forward fossil fuel production, which would overturn rules made to curb planet-heating emissions. The Trump campaign has also promised to once again pull the U.S. out of the Paris agreement, an act that Biden had reversed earlier in his presidency. Reversing executive orders is surprisingly easy for a newly instated president. On Biden\u2019s first day of his presidency, he canceled 11 of Trump\u2019s climate-related orders. Trump will certainly move to do the same and undo Biden\u2019s climate-related executive orders.\n\nIn 2023, Kevin Robert, president of the conservative Heritage Foundation, released a series of policy initiatives called Project 2025 that Trump could take if he wins the presidency again, including reversing climate actions taken by the Biden administration. The project calls for the president to use an executive order to \u201creshape the U.S. Global Change Research Program and related climate change research programs.\u201d The Global Change Research Program was established by Congress in 1990 to coordinate federal research and spending to better understand climate change. The Trump administration already moved to tamper with the Research Program during his first term, and a second term will surely mean further manipulation.\n\nThe damage that Trump could do to climate change policy would set the U.S. back years. He believes that climate change should not be a priority and isn\u2019t something we should be worried about. He wants to boost the U.S. economy by boosting fossil fuels, when we should be looking for other, clean alternatives.\n\nIf Trump is awarded a second term his climate-related policies could add an additional four billion tons of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere by 2030, compared to the Biden administration\u2019s existing plans. We would also likely miss our global climate pledge under the Paris agreement by a wide margin. The U.S. should be a leader in climate change policy and we are taking steps toward that goal, but if Trump is elected to a second term, all that work could be flushed down the drain.\n\n2RY8Y78 Former President Donald Trump gesture to the crowd before his speech at the California Republican Party Convention Friday, Sept. 29, 2023, in Anaheim, Calif.

Elizabeth Warren\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign finance co-chair Paul Egerman was among the major signatories of the letter.\n\nTheir letter blasted the current president for supporting Israel\u2019s war effort in Gaza and the country\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nIt stated, \u201cRegrettably President Biden has provided what appears to be unconditional support for the Israeli operation,\u201d it reads. \u201cThe Biden administration has been providing armaments, including 2,000-pound bombs which have been used to flatten entire civilian neighborhoods, causing massive casualties with a high ratio of women and children.\u201d\n\nBiden has been somewhat critical of Israel\u2019s methods of waging war in Gaza in recent weeks, even expressing hope that Israel would arrange a ceasefire soon.\n\nThe letter acknowledged Biden\u2019s perspective but pointed out that it hasn\u2019t changed much at all. \u201cPresident Biden has asked Netanyahu to minimize civilian casualties but has threatened no consequences as Netanyahu has continued to ignore him.\u201d\n\nIt went on to grill Biden, arguing that his policy is alienating voters and thereby undermining the hefty contributions that these donors have given to his campaign and the party ahead of 2024.\n\nThe letter continued, \u201cAs donors and activists, we have committed much time and treasure in helping increase the turnout of likely Biden voters, particularly among young voters and voters of color.\u201d\n\nSCHUMER\u2019S ANTI-NETANYAHU SPEECH STRENGTHENS BIBI IN ISRAEL\u2019S WAR TO DEFEAT HAMAS\n\n\u201cMany of these voters are now questioning whether the Democratic Party shares their values,\u201d it said, adding, \u201cIf they stay home or vote for a third-party candidate, there is the very real danger that President Biden will be defeated in November.\u201d\n\nThe letter went on to mention how much of a \u201cdisaster\u201d a second Trump administration would be \u201cfor our country and a bigger disaster for Israel/Palestine.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause of the disillusionment of a critical portion of the Democratic coalition, the Gaza war is increasing the chances of a Trump victory,\u201d it declared.\n\nThis letter is just the latest written by prominent liberals criticizing Biden\u2019s pro-Israel stance. Last December, dozens of White House interns signed a letter demanding Biden to push for a cease-fire in Israel\u2019s war and slamming him and Vice President Harris for ignoring the \u201cpleas of the American people.\u201d\n\nMore than a dozen Biden campaign staffers sent their boss a letter in January pushing for a cease-fire as well. It stated, \u201cAs your staff, we believe it is both a moral and electoral imperative for you to publicly call for a cessation of violence.\u201d",

However, addressing voters\u2019 concerns about the President\u2019s age is undoubtedly near the top of the list. The speech and Biden\u2019s ad campaign were designed to address that issue head-on.\n\nA recent Morning Consult poll shows that Biden\u2019s State of the Union made progress doing just that. According to the poll, the number of voters who say Biden is \u201ctoo old\u201d dropped by 3 points, but there was significant movement among Democrats (9 points) and Biden 2020 voters (8 points).\n\nThis is all good news. Biden\u2019s path to victory begins with winning back his 2020 voters. Trump\u2019s advantage in the polls is entirely because he is winning a higher percentage of his 2020 voters. In the New York Times/Siena poll, Trump has the support of 97% of voters who say they voted for him in 2020, while Biden only has 83% of his 2020 voters.\n\n.Navigator Research did a post-SOTU poll that found:\n\nSeven in ten Americans engaged with the State of the Union this year and a plurality viewed it positively; nearly three in five who watched at least part of the address were positive about the speech\u2026..\n\nMore\u2026.\n\nNote\u2026\n\nThe Right leaning Real Clear Politics also has Biden at 40.3% approval\u2026.",

Republicans grilled witnesses who appeared during an impeachment hearing on Wednesday.\n\nThe depth of questioning and the brutal exposure of the Bidens from one witness produced some fiery exchanges. Democrats couldn\u2019t handle the details presented right before their eyes, and some went on the attack against the voluntary witnesses.\n\nOne of the high-profile members of the radical left contingent in the House made the mistake of taking on a witness that exposed the Bidens\u2019 financial dealings. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) \u2013 known as AOC for short \u2013 challenged the testimony of Tony Bobulinski, a former business associate of the Biden family.\n\nAOC wanted a \u201csimple\u201d answer to her question, and she was hammered with more than she bargained for in the exchange. She wanted to know if Bobulinski witnessed Joe Biden committing a crime, and he responded, \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nFrom The Daily Wire:\n\n\u201cIt is simple, you name the crime,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez shot back. \u201cDid you watch him steal something?\u201d she added. Bobulinski listed \u201ccorruption statutes, RICO and conspiracy, FARA \u2026\u201d before stopping as Ocasio-Cortez tried to interject by demanding that he offer \u201cspecific\u201d crimes. \u201cYou asked me to answer the question,\u201d Bobulinski said. \u201cI answered the question. RICO, you\u2019re obviously not familiar with. Corruption statutes\u2026\u201d Ocasio-Cortez shot back, repeating, \u201cExcuse me, sir!\u201d She then singled out Bobulinski\u2019s mention of RICO. \u201cRICO is not a crime. It is a category,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd with that exclamation of her ignorance, AOC became a worldwide laughingstock of political ignorance. The media at all levels picked up on her lack of understanding of reality and the video clip went viral across social media.\n\nRICO (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act) laws against racketeering were generally used to prosecute organized crime organizations in decades past. The statutes received renewed attention following RICO charges against former President Donald Trump in Georgia related to the 2020 election.\n\nBobulinski continued his testimony as AOC continually interrupted him and demanded he name specific crimes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a category of crimes that you\u2019re then charged under,\u201d Bobulinski said. He suggested that there is a \u201clong\u201d list of statutes that would apply.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny, in this committee room \u2014 everyone\u2019s not here \u2014 there\u2019s over 18 lawyers that went to law school. I\u2019ll leave it up to you guys to define the statute,\u201d he said.\n\nRepublicans jumped on the opportunity to expose AOC for her ignorance of the laws she should know in her position in Congress. The Oversight Committee, which held the hearing, placed a post on its X account aimed at AOC: \u201cHINT: RICO is a federal law codified at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1961-68.\u201d\n\nAnother Republican aptly summed up how leftist Democrats perform in Congress when the cameras are rolling.\n\n\u201cWeekly meltdown by Rep. AOC,\u201d said Rep. Nancy Mace (R-SC). \u201cSomeone needs to remind the Left, just because you are loud, does not mean you are right.\u201d\n\nAOC made a complete ass of herself for all the world to see. Anyone supporting this political charlatan at any level of leadership should be tossed from office along with her. She has presented herself as an ignorant disgrace who should not be recognized by the media or Congress going forward.\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\nAOC disgraced herself with an ignorant exclamation during an impeachment hearing.\n\nThe radical leftist House representative screamed at a witness, \u201cRICO is not a crime.\u201d\n\nAOC and radicals like her seem to believe shouting ignorantly is a way to make a point.\n\nSource: The Daily Wire",

            "text": "Final yr, German well being minister Karl Lauterbach did one thing politicians virtually by no means do except they\u2019ve been caught with their pants down: He apologized. Closing colleges for lengthy intervals throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, Lauterbach mentioned, had been an \u201cpointless mistake.\u201d\n\nThe place is our Lauterbach?\n\nAlthough President Joe Biden wasn\u2019t in workplace at first of the pandemic, he and different outstanding Democrats have had ample alternatives to account for his or her roles in a slow-motion catastrophe that started virtually precisely 4 years in the past, when colleges closed \u201cquickly\u201d within the earliest days of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nAfter what was speculated to be a merely momentary closure, New York Metropolis introduced on March 23, 2020, that it was transferring to distant studying for the remainder of the yr. That day, distant studying \u201cformally\u201d started in Washington, D.C., too, after days of haphazard experimentation with digital schooling. Comparable experiments emerged throughout the nation, as mother and father realized\u2014with dread, in lots of instances\u2014that the societal disruption of the coronavirus was going to final.\n\n4 years later, the injuries haven\u2019t totally healed.\n\nTrue, Republican resistance to masks and vaccines harmed and killed many extra folks than any coverage embraced by liberals. However I don\u2019t assume I\u2019m alone in anticipating higher ethical readability from Biden than from Donald Trump. And relating to faculty, it\u2019s clear that Democrats haven\u2019t actually reckoned with the choices they made in 2020 and 2021.\n\nEarlier this week, a knowledge evaluation by The New York Instances summarized the impact of the closures that started 4 years in the past: \u201c\u2026prolonged faculty closures didn\u2019t considerably cease the unfold of COVID, whereas the tutorial harms for youngsters have been massive and long-lasting.\u201d The longer colleges stayed closed (or partly closed, with college students solely attending faculty in-person one or two days per week), the extra youngsters fell behind.\n\nThe devastating results of distant studying are evident at the moment within the absenteeism disaster, the instructor scarcity, and the spike in psychological sickness amongst younger adults.\n\nThis week, The Instances additionally reported that metropolis colleges \u201care grappling with a spike in self-discipline issues amongst youngsters, proof that the disruptions brought on by the coronavirus pandemic are having lingering results, educators and consultants say.\u201d It\u2019s not nearly check scores. Our kids misplaced one thing important as a result of adults lacked the braveness to do the precise factor.\n\nThus, the deep bitterness many mother and father felt about having to play \u201cinstructor\u201d for months on finish. That bitterness manifested within the suburbs of Northern Virginia in Nov. 2021, serving to Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, turn out to be the state\u2019s subsequent governor. And it\u2019s nonetheless there, ready to floor in Nov. 2024.\n\n\u201cI believe mother and father who noticed their youngsters undergo from politics slightly than scientific rules in making coverage choices nonetheless take into consideration the extended faculty closures within the U.S.,\u201d Monica Gandhi, a professor of medication on the College of California at San Francisco who bravely known as for colleges to reopen lengthy earlier than lots of her friends, wrote to me in an e mail.\n\nGrievances are likely to work on voters greater than guarantees, I\u2019ve discovered. The grievances of oldsters\u2014moms in suburban swing districts, for example\u2014may damage Biden a lot the best way they did former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, the president\u2019s pal, when he ran confidently in opposition to the inexperienced Youngkin.\n\nIt ought to have by no means come to this. By summer season 2020, we knew that youngsters, for probably the most half, don\u2019t get particularly sick with COVID-19. And round that point we additionally knew that colleges have been by no means the viral incubators some claimed they have been certain to turn out to be. Research from South Korea, the UK, and different international locations confirmed as a lot. So did the secure reopening of faculties in crimson states like Florida and Texas.\n\nBy some means, proof didn\u2019t appear to matter. Individuals who claimed to \u201ctake heed to the science\u201d turned away when the science mentioned colleges ought to reopen.\n\n\u201cLiberals actually poisoned the effectively after they determined to wage struggle in opposition to anybody who dared to make any public well being calculations throughout the pandemic, even if such calculations have been inevitable and obligatory,\u201d wrote the perceptive author Freddie deBoer in a current Substack e-newsletter. \u201cThe relentless braying about \u2018eugenics,\u2019 the insistence that anybody who was not a [non-pharmaceutical intervention] maximalist hated the disabled and wished them to die, contributed on to the backlash that has resulted in a lot COVID conspiracy madness.\u201d\n\nIf Govs. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) and Greg Abbott (R-TX) have been reopening colleges, then reopening colleges needed to be improper, as a result of DeSantis and Abbott didn\u2019t belief the science and have been xenophobic bigots in addition\u2014so the righteous considering went on the time. To oppose them was to oppose every little thing improper with America below Trump. So the colleges stayed closed in most deep blue municipalities.\n\nIn a harrowing article for The New Yorker printed in fall 2020, reporter Alec MacGillis bracingly revealed the scope of devastation distant studying dropped at poor youngsters, particularly poor youngsters of shade.\n\nMost chilling of all was the transparently disingenuous protection of college closures by Becky Pringle, head of the highly effective Nationwide Schooling Affiliation (NEA), of which First Girl Jill Biden is a member. Pringle preposterously informed MacGillis that if colleges reopened, some 50,000 youngsters would die. However no information outlet fact-checked her. Nobody accused Pringle of peddling misinformation, the best way they might have if a conservative had made so flagrantly baseless an assertion.\n\n\u201c By some means, proof didn\u2019t appear to matter. Individuals who claimed to \u2018take heed to the science\u2019 turned away when the science mentioned colleges ought to reopen. \u201d\n\nAmazingly, some union leaders proceed to defend having closed down colleges for months on finish. \u201cI do imagine it was the precise resolution,\u201d Jerry Jordan of the Philadelphia Federation of Lecturers informed The Instances this week. It\u2019s a defiant assertion, and an indefensible one. And except Democrats resign it, they personal it.\n\nIt\u2019s true that we didn\u2019t know the way critical the virus was at first, which justified closing colleges and companies. However a state of everlasting emergency was unsustainable; as soon as we realized how the virus behaved, we should always have adjusted accordingly. But some \u201cconsultants\u201d continued to insist on masking outdoors and retaining colleges closed.\n\n4 years in the past, we have been misplaced within the \u201cfog of struggle.\u201d The fog was thick at first, however by Might it did start to carry. We began to know the true risk of the virus, whom it harmed and for whom it was a really minor danger. But in lots of highly-populated jurisdictions ruled by Democrats, nothing modified. It was virtually as in the event that they longed for the fog to remain.\n\nNow, there should be some sincere accountability. We don\u2019t want blue ribbon commissions or Capitol Hill hearings to relitigate how we responded to the pandemic. However we do want elected leaders to have the decency to confess their very own errors.\n\n\u201cThe Buck Stops Right here,\u201d mentioned the well-known signal on President Harry Truman\u2019s desk.\n\nThe place does the buck cease in 2024? No one owns their choices or owns as much as their errors. There\u2019s an virtually Soviet avoidance of accountability. This certain is terrible, but it surely\u2019s not my fault. That man over there, he appears responsible. Off to the gulag!\n\nIf you happen to ask the White Home, they\u2019ll let you know that Biden shortly received colleges open in 2021. That\u2019s true. Sort of.\n\nBut it surely took billions of federal stimulus {dollars}, and in lots of districts, unsatisfactory hybrid studying continued. Then, when the Delta variant got here alongside in late 2021, many faculties closed once more\u2014with an particularly protracted refusal to return to the classroom by the academics of Chicago, the place in a number of months Democrats will maintain their nationwide conference.\n\n\u201cDad and mom who noticed their youngsters undergo from politics slightly than scientific rules in making coverage choices nonetheless take into consideration the extended faculty closures within the U.S.,\u201d Dr. Gandhi wrote to me.\u201cI believe an apology and acknowledgement of the errors Democrats made on this epidemic in the direction of youngsters would go a great distance in serving to their constituents forgive.\u201d\n\nThere have been loads of issues that Democrats received proper concerning the pandemic. However no person, wherever, received it utterly proper. Not China, not California, not Florida, not Sweden. We all know that now. Our political leaders ought to be courageous sufficient to say it.",

It will fill a critical electricity generation gap following Pennsylvania\u2019s largest coal plant\u2018s closure in July 2023.\n\nRenewables developer Swift Current Energy (SCE) will build a utility-scale 402 MW solar farm capable of producing enough clean energy to power 75,000 homes. SCE says on Mineral Basin\u2019s website that it\u2019s considering adopting offsite battery energy storage for the project.\n\nMineral Basin will serve as a pilot for SCE, which plans to develop around 1,000 MW of solar on former coal mine sites in the Appalachian region over the next five years.\n\nThe federal funding for the solar farm was announced today by the US Department of Energy and came from money already earmarked by the Biden administration\u2019s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.\n\nSecretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm said, \u201cThanks to the President\u2019s Investing in America agenda, DOE is helping deploy clean energy solutions on current and former mine land across the country \u2013 supporting jobs and economic development in the areas hit hardest by our evolving energy landscape.\u201d\n\nThe project expects to create more than 750 construction jobs and six operations jobs, while providing $1.1 million in annual tax revenue to townships, the county, and local school district.\n\nConstruction on Pennsylvania\u2019s largest solar farm could begin this summer, and it\u2019s expected to come online by the second half of 2026. The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) awarded it a 20-year power purchase agreement in November 2023.\n\nMineral Basin Solar Power, LLC, says it will invest nearly $20 million in economic development to create opportunities for young people and adults who want to upskill, right-skill, and reskill across high-demand sectors in the 27-county region.\n\nTo limit power outages and make your home more resilient, consider going solar with a battery storage system.

Gwen Moore appeared on MSNBC\u2019s The Weekend after being seated next to Marjorie Taylor Greene through President Joe Biden\u2019s entire SOTU speech and wasted no time in dishing all the details on Greene\u2019s antics from the evening \u2014 including the outlandish nonsense Marjorie was talking to herself about all night.\n\nMoore says she took the seat beside Greene because she arrived late to the event and didn\u2019t want to stand the entire evening, despite being told that the seat was open because no one wanted to sit next to the batshit crazy Georgia Republican.\n\n\u201cI thought I would just ignore her but I couldn\u2019t, you know?\u201d Rep. Moore said when the MSNBC panel began to press her about the overall experience. \u201cI was fact-checking her in real-time.\u201d\n\nEventually, the hosts started to ask Moore for specific examples: \u201cI was trying to draw \u2014 bring out some empathy and to see if she had any, you know, and to recognize that, you know, instead of spending all of our time, you know, being surprised and shocked at Donald Trump having these supporters to try to listen to them.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor example, this is a really good example,\u201d Moore continued. \u201cWhen he [Biden] talked about Bettie May Fikes, who I have met on the march to Selma to the Edmund Pettus Bridge when he talked about her being there and voting rights and John Lewis. She said, \u20181965?\u2019 She was really truly surprised, I think. \u2018Nobody is having their \u2014 being prevented from voting.\u2019 Now, that was 1965. I said \u2018no girl, they tried to take my vote from me,\u2019 because I voted and used a drop box in the last election.'\u201d\n\nShe went on to add that Greene grew more and more unhinged as President Biden began to talk about COVID-19.\n\n\u201cShe was muttering about how we shuttered businesses and so forth during Covid,\u201d Moore recalled. \u201cI said, \u2018Girl, well, Covid was a real thing. My eldest son almost died from Covid and was in the hospital on a ventilator for a week.\u201d\n\nYou can watch the MSNBC clip here:\n\n\ufeff\n\nWas the crisis in Afghanistan surrounding the pull out of American Troops Biden's fault or Trump's fault?

            "text": "In February, President Joe Biden\u2019s reelection campaign demonstrated a significant increase in fundraising, collecting $21 million, which elevated its cash on hand to $71 million. This financial boost contributed to a combined total of $97.5 million available for Biden\u2019s campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC), a figure that notably surpasses the $44.8 million held by former President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign and the Republican National Committee (RNC). These figures exclude funds from both parties\u2019 joint fundraising efforts.\n\nDespite trailing behind Trump in early polling for the general election, Biden\u2019s growing financial resources provide an edge. In contrast, Trump\u2019s fundraising this cycle has not matched his 2020 campaign efforts, partly due to funds being allocated to his legal expenses through a leadership PAC. Biden\u2019s campaign has been considerably more frugal in legal spending, reporting only $122,000 in such expenses.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign is leveraging its financial advantage to initiate a substantial advertising push, marked by a recent $30 million investment in TV and digital ads, aimed at countering Trump. Although Biden\u2019s fundraising totals still fall short of those seen in the 2020 campaign for the same period, the campaign\u2019s strategic ad spending and mockery of Trump\u2019s financial challenges underscore its aggressive approach.\n\nIn addition to ad expenditures, Biden\u2019s campaign is ramping up its operations. Following the State of the Union address, a new ad campaign targeting swing states was launched, with $1.9 million spent on advertising in just one week. The campaign also celebrated a $10 million fundraising milestone within 24 hours post-State of the Union.\n\nOperational expenses are on the rise, with February\u2019s payroll expanding from nearly $1.2 million in January to over $1.6 million. Significant investments were made in media production, travel, and text messaging, alongside notable spending at Capriotti\u2019s Sandwich Shop, a favorite of Biden\u2019s. As the campaign moves forward, it plans to significantly increase staff, particularly in swing states, indicating a strategic build-up for the forthcoming election battle.",

            "text": "You\u2019ve probably seen the video by now of that pack of feral invaders overwhelming and assaulting the Texas National Guard at the border. More than a hundred illegal aliens shoved past the Guardsmen who were all armed with automatic rifles.\n\nThey got past the razor wire and initial barricades but appear to have been stopped by the much larger border fence behind that. Thankfully, none of the American soldiers were killed, but that is likely to happen soon after this incident.\n\nWe should all brace ourselves, because the horrors of this illegal alien crime wave are going to get much worse before things start to get better.\n\nMost of this pack of invaders were former soldiers or even commandoes in their home countries. Therefore, they understand the concept of \u201crules of engagement,\u201d or ROE. Even though all the Texas National Guardsmen were armed, they didn\u2019t shoot any of the invaders as they were being assaulted. If ever there was a situation where someone should be able to lawfully gun down an attacker because they\u2019re in fear for their life, it was this one.\n\nThe soldiers didn\u2019t shoot any of the attackers, however, because they were following orders. Their rules of engagement say that they\u2019re not allowed to shoot the invaders, even when their own lives are in imminent danger.\n\nThe illegals know this now. Even though border agents and national guardsmen are carrying automatic rifles, the troops won\u2019t shoot because they have been hamstrung by their cowardly leaders who set the ROE.\n\nDo you think the situation at the border gets better from this point, now that the illegals know that the soldiers won\u2019t shoot them no matter what they do? It can only get worse from here.\n\nIn Rockland, Massachusetts, population 17,803, the illegal aliens living rent-free in the local hotels are receiving $64 a day for food. That\u2019s $469 a week, per person. They also get vouchers for up to $189 worth of \u201cfree\u201d dry cleaning every week\u2014per person.\n\nEvery illegal alien is also provided with a free laptop, probably so they can look for a job to steal from an American worker. They also get free tablets and free smartphones. They mostly sit around in public areas watching porn on these devices with the sound turned all the way up. We\u2019re so enriched by all this diversity! Thank you so much, Joe Biden!\n\nIn a show of gratitude for this largesse that the taxpayers are showering them with, some of the invaders from Haiti viciously raped a 15-year-old girl.\n\nIn Highgate, Vermont, population 3,472, local entrepreneur Kristy Brow used to enjoy taking quiet evening walks with her dogs on her 21-acre wooded property. These days, she locks her doors at night and stays inside with a loaded rifle at the ready. Dangerous-looking invaders are always traipsing through the woods on her property these days, which is next to the Canadian border.\n\nIn fiscal year 2021, the Border Patrol caught 916 illegal aliens trying to cross from Canada into the US. Last year, thanks to Joe Biden\u2019s invitation, they encountered 189,401 invaders (and let them all in). No matter what state you live in, you are not safe from what\u2019s coming.\n\nIn Florissant, Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis, an illegal alien woman from Venezuela was driving 70 miles an hour in the wrong lane when she caused a head-on collision with the Wolfe family. That happened in December, the day before Travis Wolfe\u2019s 13th birthday. After remaining in a coma for several months, Travis died on March 5th.\n\nA 19-year-old illegal alien from Honduras crossed the border in Eagle Pass, TX, last October and has been wreaking havoc across the country ever since. He committed at least one armed robbery, stabbed a person in another incident, and brutally assaulted someone in another attack. In every instance, he was released without bail after being arrested. In Kenner, Louisiana, population 66,448, he raped a 14-year-old. He\u2019s finally being held in jail on an ICE detainer.\n\nTragedies like these are only going to accelerate and grow more frequent as 2024 drags on. Laken Riley will not be the only American girl whose name we all know by the end of this year.\n\nDeporting them is going to be a challenge even after Donald Trump is back in the White House. There are just too many of them and they are everywhere. Hopefully the troops will have new rules of engagement once Big Orange is back in charge, because that seems like the only way that we\u2019re going to be able to turn this around.",

            "text": "Private Residence\n\nDallas, Texas\n\n7:24 P.M. CDT\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you. (Applause.) I don\u2019t know where he\u2019s been, but I want to go there. (Laughter.)\n\nRussell and Dori, thank you for your friendship. You know, you heas- \u2014 you hosted me the first time for a fundraiser in 2019. And it\u2019s fitting that you\u2019re hosting my first Texas fundraiser for 2024.\n\nA special thanks to all of you: Jaime Harrison and \u2014 the chair of the \u2014 of the \u2014 our \u2014 our party; Chris, our finance chair; and all the lawyers here today who care deeply about the rule of law and the frontlines of fairness and justice and \u2014 and deepening democracy and defending it, because I think it\u2019s at stake.\n\nYou know, folks, we\u2019re seeing incredible enthusiasm all over the country as we travel. Recently, I\u2019ve traveled to Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia, Wisconsin, New Hampshire, Nevada, Arizona. And Jill and Kamala and Doug are traveling as well.\n\nOur grassroots support, thank God, keeps getting stronger. So far, over 1.3 million people have contributed to our campaign this time around \u2014 500,000 of them, brand new \u2014 and 97 percent of those contributions are $200 or less \u2014 97 percent of them.\n\nAnd we\u2019re ramping up our many campaign headquarters, off- \u2014 field offices across the country. We\u2019ve opened a hundred field offices so far and staffing them all now \u2014 and before Trump has opened a \u2014 and his MAGA Republican friends \u2014 have opened even one. (Laughter.)\n\nAnd while you probably haven\u2019t read about it, in the last few days, there have been five national polls where we\u2019re back to leading again in the polls. (Applause.)\n\nBut the truth is I\u2019m not sure any of them matter, because it\u2019s so hard to take polls these days. It really is. And not everyone is feeling the enthusiasm. Not everyone.\n\nJust the other day, a defeated-looking guy came up to me and said, \u201cMr. President, I need your help. I\u2019m being crushed with debt. I\u2019m completely wiped out.\u201d I had to say, \u201cDonald, I can\u2019t help you.\u201d (Laughter and applause.) (Inaudible.)\n\nSpeaking of Donald Trump, just a few days ago, he asked a famous question in one of his rallies: Are you better off today than you were four years ago?\n\nAUDIENCE: Yes!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, Donald, I\u2019m glad you asked that question, man. (Laughter.) I hope everyone in the country takes a moment to think back what it was like in March of 2020.\n\nCOVID had come to America. Trump was president. Hospitals, emergency rooms were overcrowded. First responders were risking their lives. Nurses were wear- \u2014 were wear- \u2014 were wearing garbage bags because they couldn\u2019t have the protection in the hospitals they needed. There was a ventilator shortage. Morgues were being set up all outside, not just in the hospitals. And the loved ones were dying all alone. We couldn\u2019t even say goodbye to them.\n\nAnd unemployment shot up to 14 percent. The stock market crashed. Grocery store shelves were emply \u2014 and were empty. And we even \u2014 remember the whole toilet paper conference? (Laughter.) No, I\u2019m \u2014 think about how tough things were.\n\nYou know, months ago Trump tried to downplay the virus. He told us, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it will go away. Just stay calm. And we\u2019ll\u201d \u2014 remember he said, \u201cWe\u2019ll be out of it by Easter\u201d? Well, over a million people died. And while \u2014 all while doing nothing.\n\nOf course, we now know Bob Woodward\u2019s book \u2014 that Trump was lying to the American people all along. He knew how dangerous the virus was, and he hid it from us. He just kept getting worse \u2014 worse and worse. He told Americans \u2014 remember he was telling \u201cinject bleach\u201d? He told us to hit the body with UV light. Well \u2014 (laughter).\n\nBut later, you know, he wanted to tear gas the photo op \u2014 for a photo op, out \u2014 because they protested justice in front of the White House.\n\nThen, after losing the 2020 election, Trump finished his presidency by sending an interrecti- \u2014 an insurrection mob to the Capitol. And, folks, look, there\u2019s \u2014 these folks \u2014 so many of them have been convicted. And he swears when he gets elected he\u2019s going to pardon them all \u2014 pardon them all \u2014 because they\u2019re \u201cheroes.\u201d\n\nBut four years later, look at where we \u2014 how far we\u2019ve come. Donald Trump is not president \u2014 that\u2019s the first thing \u2014 because of you. (Applause.) And I mean it \u2014 because of many of you.\n\nCOVID no longer controls our lives. We\u2019ve created 15 million new jobs \u2014 more jobs in that timeframe than any president has in American history. (Applause.) We have the lowest unemployment rate in over 50 years. We had record economic growth, new small-business creation record, stock market is highest it\u2019s ever been.\n\nInsulin now costs seniors 35 bucks instead of 400 bucks a month. Out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs for seniors are going to be capped at $2,000 a year, no matter what the total cost is.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t just save seniors money; it saves taxpayers significant amounts of money.\n\nBy just passing that law and what we\u2019ve done so far, we\u2019ve saved \u2014 we\u2019ve reduced the deficit by $160 billion \u2014 $160 billion. If you\u2019re not paying $400 instead of $15, and so on. Go down the line. I won\u2019t bore you with detail.\n\nWe\u2019re rebuilding the nation\u2019s roads and bridges. We\u2019re delivering clean water and high-speed Internet to every American, whether you\u2019re rural or no matter where you live.\n\nAmerican manufacturing is booming \u2014 800,000 manufacturing jobs and counting. And be- \u2014 you all know this as well as I do: We\u2019ve attracted over $650 billion dollars in private-sector investment in clean energy, advanced manufacturing, semiconductors \u2014 all across America. (Applause.) We made the biggest investment in history to combat climate change. And we can do a lot more, of course, and we have to.\n\nInflation peaked at 9 percent a little over a couple of years ago \u2014 a year and a half ago. Now, it\u2019s dropped to 3 percent \u2014 the lowest in the world \u2014 and still dropping. We\u2019re going to do more \u2014 more to be done.\n\nSo, let me ask you: Does anyone here want to go back to 2020? (Laughs.)\n\nAUDIENCE: No!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, when fear ruled our lives, when Trump was president \u2014 I don\u2019t think so.\n\nBut, look, the problem isn\u2019t just going back to Trump ha- \u2014 where Trump had the country. The problem is he wants to take us \u2014 where he wants to take us now. Look at what he\u2019s saying, and I hope that we all begin to take seriously. He means what he says. As crazy as it sounds, he means what he says.\n\nHe wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. Over 30 million Americans depend on the ACA. It would be a disaster for the \u2014 to be taken away.\n\nHe wants to get rid of the savings I just got put into law for prescription drugs at 35 bucks for \u2014 for insulin \u2014 for a whole range of \u2014 and he just wants to wipe it all out.\n\nYou know, and what he wants to do is enact another $2 trillion tax cut. Well, at the time, you know, he increased the deficit larger than any man in American history in four years \u2014 the deficit.\n\nHouse Republicans just proposed massive cuts in Social Security and Medicare. Trump recently said, \u201cSocial security and Medicare \u2014 there\u2019s a lot you can do to cut more.\u201d\n\nWell, folks, the climate \u2014 he\u2019s a climate denier. And he\u2019s going to do away with the historic action that we\u2019ve taken. There\u2019s a lot more to do. I\u2019m not suggesting we\u2019ve finished.\n\nBut another school shooting recently, and what did he say? He said \u2014 when asked about it, he said, \u201cJust get over it.\u201d \u201cJust get over it.\u201d\n\nNo \u2014 no, I want to stop it, not get over it. The idea our children are having to duck and cover in school. Did you ever think we\u2019d be in that position? Ever think we\u2019d be teaching kids that?\n\nLook \u2014 look at the judges he put on the bench. Imagine who else he\u2019ll put on the bench.\n\nOur reputation internationally has been crushed when he was president. Imagine what will happen if he\u2019s reelected. He wants to do away with NATO, and he wants to tell Putin to do whatever you want \u2014 do whatever you want.\n\nTrump boasts he \u2014 what I found so stunning: He recently hosted Viktor Orb\u00e1n, the Prime Minister of Hungary, at Mar-a-Lago. And Orb\u00e1n says he doesn\u2019t think democracy works \u2014 it doesn\u2019t work. And that\u2019s who he admires most.\n\nHe brags about how he ha- \u2014 he\u2019s the reason Roe v. Wade is overturned and the freedom to choose is taken away. Look, and American needs to know: Donald Trump and his MAGA extremists are now calling for a national ban \u2014 a national ban on abortion in every state in the Union.\n\nFolks, one more thing. Trump didn\u2019t just bring chaos to the lives of women. He is also bringing chaos to the American border.\n\nWith a group of bipartisan senators we put together over a five-month period, the very conservative \u2014 a very conservative senator from Oklahoma heading the group \u2014 of a meeting for five \u2014 five solid weeks toward the end, we agreed on the strongest border security law in American history: 1,500 more Border Security agents and officers; 100 more immigration judges to tackle the backlog of 2 million cases; 4,300 asylum officers and new policy so they can resolve six \u2014 issues in six months instead of, now, six years; 100 more high-tech drug detection machines to significantly decrease the ability to \u2014 to smuggle in fentanyl and all its precursors.\n\nBut Trump \u2014 the problem is \u2014 I\u2019ve been around a while. I don\u2019t ever remember the leader of another party saying the reason they want to \u2014 their party to vote against something \u2014 not because it wasn\u2019t good but because he worried I would get too much credit for it \u2014 the other team would get credit for it.\n\nFolks, it wasn\u2019t about whether it\u2019s good for me or Trump; it\u2019s about what\u2019s good for America.\n\nBut here\u2019s what I \u2014 here\u2019s what I will not do. Unlike Trump, I\u2019m not going to demonize immigrants. I will not say immigrants are \u201cpoisoning the blood\u201d of this nation. I will not call immigrants \u201crapists\u201d and \u201cmurderers.\u201d I will not separate families, put kids in cages. I\u2019ll not end the birthright citizenship.\n\nNow, this guy actually wants to end \u2014 and he\u2019s \u2014 now he\u2019s bragging about it. He wants to end the right for birthright citizenship, which we established way back, a couple hundred years ago. If you\u2019re born in America, you\u2019re an American citizen. He wants to end that.\n\nI\u2019m not going to ban people because of religion. That\u2019s not who we are as Americans.\n\nFolks, but after all the threats Trump poses, to our economy, our standing in the world, is \u2014 the greatest threat he poses is to our democracy. Violence on January 6th \u2014 Trump embraced and he\u2019s running on it. He\u2019s running on it. He calls insurrectionists who are in prison \u2014 in prison \u2014 found guilty and in prison \u2014 he calls them \u201cpatriots.\u201d He suggests that they are, in fact, the ones who should be \u2014 and he swears if he gets elected, he\u2019s going to pardon them \u2014 pardon them all.\n\nTrump now says if he loses again in November, there will be a \u201cbloodbath\u201d in the streets.\n\nYou know, we didn\u2019t \u2014 when I got elected, and you helped me get elected in 2020, I \u2014 I made a speech on democracy at Independence Hall. I said we\u2019re in danger of losing the democracy if we don\u2019t win this thing. Well, folks, we can\u2019t stand for this stuff. We have to say in one voice as Americans \u2014 as Democrats, independents, and Republicans \u2014 there\u2019s no place for violence in America ever, ever, ever. Period. (Applause.)\n\nAnd I\u2019ll probably get her in trouble, but I just read what Liz Cheney recently said. She said, \u201cYou can\u2019t possibly vote for him, because democracy is at stake.\u201d And when asked, she said she\u2019d vote for Biden. The idea that a woman who is \u2014 has very different id- \u2014 ideas on policy than I do is so concerned that this guy gets reelected \u2014 what will happen.\n\nLook, let me close with this, because you\u2019re standing. You know, I couldn\u2019t be \u2014 the stakes couldn\u2019t be higher across the board. And with your help, we\u2019re going to win up and down the ticket. That includes here in Texas, because I want to see \u2014 you got to elect Colin your next senator. (Applause.) You got to so Ted Cruz joins another loser, Donald Trump. (Laughter.)\n\nLooks, there\u2019s a lot of focus these days on how old Trump is and how old I am. I\u2019m two \u2014 two times 40. But I \u2014 you know, what the hell? (Laughter.)\n\nThe real question is \u2014 all kidding aside \u2014 is how old are ideas? How old are our ideas?\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s vision of America is one of anger, hate revenge, retribution \u2014 some of the oldest known ideas to man.\n\nI have a very different vision for America, one that focuses on the future and answers questions \u2014 important questions: Are you better off now, and will you be better off four years from now?\n\nHere\u2019s the future I see, and I\u2019ll be brief. I see a future where we defend democracy and we don\u2019t diminish it.\n\nI see a future where we restore the right to choose and protect the freedoms, not take them away.\n\nI see a future \u2014 (applause) \u2014 I see a future where the middle class finally has a fair shot and the wealthy, the su- \u2014 you know, we have a thousand billionaires. I \u2014 I respect anybody who can make as much money as they can legally. But you know what their average tax \u2014 you know what the tax is of a \u2014 for those thousand billionaires in America? 8.2 percent. Anybody want to trade that rate? (Laughter.)\n\nNo \u2014 no, but I\u2019m serious. This \u2014 this is \u2014 you know, if \u2013 if they just got paid \u2014 if they just paid the 25 percent, do you know how much money that would raise? Four hundred billion dollars over 10 years.\n\nImagine what we could do \u2014 from everything from the deficit to taking care of kids, education, so many \u2014\n\nI see a future where we save the planet from the climate crisis and our country from gun violence.\n\nLook, I own weapons. I own guns. But this \u2014 from the very beginning, the Second Amendment didn\u2019t say you can own any weapon. You couldn\u2019t own a cannon. You couldn\u2019t own a \u2014 I\u2019m serious.\n\nAnd so, above all, I really do \u2014 I give you my word \u2014 I see a future for all Americans where we don\u2019t demonize one another and we give hate no safe harbor and we leave nobody behind. That\u2019s a future we can build together. That\u2019s the reason I\u2019ve never been more optimistic about our future.\n\nMy dad used to have an expression, God love him. My dad was a high school-educated guy who was well-read. He got into Johns Hopkins. But during the war, he never made it to Hopkins.\n\nMy dad used to say, \u201cJoey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It\u2019s about your dignity. It\u2019s about respect. It\u2019s about having a chance. It\u2019s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, \u2018Honey, it\u2019s going to be okay,\u2019 and mean it.\u201d Well, that\u2019s what this is about: giving everybody a shot.\n\nWe are the most incredible nation in the world. I know that sounds like I\u2019m bragging about our country, but I am. I think it\u2019s real. We\u2019re the only nation in the world, as I said before, that have come \u2014 come out of every crisis we faced stronger than we went in \u2014 stronger than when we went in.\n\nWe have to remember who in the hell we are. We are the United States of America. And I believe with all my \u2014 every fiber of my being there\u2019s not a single thing beyond our capacity to get done when we act together. I mean that from the bottom of my heart.\n\nSo, God bless you all. Thanks for giving me a shot to do it again. And may God protect our troops. (Applause.) Thank you.\n\nEvery time I\u2019d walk out of my Grandfathers Finnegan\u2019s house in Scranton he\u2019d yell, \u201cJoey, keep the faith.\u201d And my grandmother would yell, \u201cNo, Joey. Spread it.\u201d Let\u2019s go spread it.\n\nThank you. (Applause.)\n\n7:39 P.M. CDT",

EST\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Chief White, thank you for that introduction.\n\nListen:\n\nAnd, you know, every day, you and your fellow officers put on that shield, walk out the door, and your families worry about receiving that phone call. But thank you for your service and, I mean this sincerely, your sacrifice and the sacrifice of that of your family. It\u2019s not just you \u2014 your families as well.\n\nAnd thanks to the law enforcement and community leaders here today who have helped bring down violent crime rates in their cities to historic lows.\n\nThat\u2019s right. We\u2019re \u2014 we\u2019re about to talk about what\u2019s going to happen now. You know, you just heard from the chief, and they salute these cities who are making historic progress here.\n\nLast year, the United States had one of the lowest rates of all violent crime \u2014 of all violent crimes in more than 50 years. Murder, rape \u2014 murder, rape, aggravated assault, robbery all dropped sharply, along with burglary, property crime, and theft. And it matters.\n\nAs President, public safety \u2014 public safety and crime reduction is a top priority for my administration and for me. And it has been for a long time, back when I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee.\n\nYou know, since day one, my administration has been working with law enforcement, mayors, and community leaders to do what we know works to keep people and communities safe.\n\nAs was referenced, during the pandemic, states and cities saw violent crime rising, and their budgets were strained as they faced deep cuts in law enforcement and public safety. But we stepped up.\n\nThanks to my American Rescue Plan, which I might note not a single person on the other team voted for, we provided $350 billion \u2014 $350 billion that was available to deal with these issues. You know, and the fact is that we find ourselves \u2014 they could use it to \u2014 this money to keep law enforcement on the beat and communities safe from violence.\n\nWe invested $15 billion \u2014 $15 billion to make their communities safer, and we added billions more in grants to help. The Justice Department invested in law enforcement and community violence interruption programs.\n\nBecause of the American Rescue Plan, we have the largest federal investment of fighting crime and preventing violent crime in any time in our history. And that\u2019s a big deal.\n\nYou know, we\u2019re \u2014 we know being in law enforcement is harder than ever. But \u2014 and we expect you to be everything to everybody. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve invested in more crisis responders who work alongside police officers \u2014 as Chief said, mental health and social workers \u2014 to respond to non-violent crimes as well.\n\nMore investments in recruiting, retaining, and training officers. More investments in violence prevention to get guns off the streets.\n\nAnd on top of that, we\u2019re hiring more U.S. attorneys, recruiting more U.S. marshals, and investing in more technology and training to clear the court backlogs, solve murders, and deal with apprehending violent fugitives.\n\nAnd we\u2019re also working hard to ensure bonds of trust between officers and the people you all serve. My budget calls for more officers on the street trained in community policing, walking the beat, working hard hand in hand with community leaders and partners and public \u2014 to gain public trust and advance public safety.\n\nThe chiefs in this room know that when their communities trust the police, we can solve a hell of a lot more crimes a hell of a lot faster.\n\nThat\u2019s why I signed the historic executive order to advance executive [effective] and accountable community policing, and it\u2019s very effective so far. You know, and I\u2019m going to continue to call on Congress to pass the George Floyd Policing and Justice \u2014 the Justice in Policing Act so we can make police reform the law of the land.\n\nWe\u2019ve also made historic investments in proven strategies to interrupt and prevent crime and violence in the first place. These programs use trusted messengers, including people \u2014 people who are in the neighborhood, people who have \u2014 have been incarcerated and are released now, people who have been through it, people who know what they\u2019re talking about.\n\nAnd we have a track record of reducing violent crime, as a consequence of that, by 30 to 60 percent where those programs exist.\n\nAnd finally, my plan goes after the scourge of gun violence in America. I\u2019ve taken more executive actions to stop the flow of illegal guns than any other administration in history. And we beat the NRA when I signed the most significant gun safety law in nearly 30 years.\n\nAnd we\u2019re going to finish the job. We\u2019re going to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines next time around because it has to be done.\n\nI formed the \u2014 the first-ever White House Gun Violence \u2014 White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, and I thank Vice President Harris for overseeing this important effort.\n\nLet me close with this. Our plan is working, but we still have much more to do, as everyone at this table knows. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re here today.\n\nMy administration is going to choose progress over politics, and communities across the country are safer as a result of that policy. There is no greater responsibility than to ensure the safety of families, children, communities, and our nation.\n\nAnd with that, I want to turn this over to Neera Tanden, my Domestic Policy Advisor, and we\u2019ll get this discussion going. Okay? Thank you. (Applause.)\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\nMS. TANDEN: Thank you. I would like to invite the press to exit before we start our discussion.\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Louder. Louder. Can\u2019t hear you.\n\nMS. TANDEN: I would like \u2014 (laughs).\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\nQ Mr. President, how did \u2014 how did your physical go today? Are you okay? Everything good?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: All right. Everything is squared away.\n\nQ Anything concerning that Americans should know about, about your health?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, they think I look too young. (Laughter.)\n\nQ They think you look too young? How \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you.\n\nNo, there is nothing different than last year.\n\nQ Everything is great?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Everything is great.\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\nQ What about on McConnell stepping down?\n\nQ On McConnell stepping down?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I\u2019m sorry to see McConnell step down. He and I \u2014 I trusted him. We\u2019ve had a great relationship. We fight like hell, but he never, never, never misrepresents anything. I\u2019m sorry to hear of him stepping down.\n\nThank you.\n\n2:06 P.M. EST",

            "text": "Ukraine war: Russia\u2019s Baltic neighbours to create massive border defences as Trump continues undermining Nato\n\nBy Natasha LindstaedtProfessor, Department of Government, University of Essex\n\nEssex, Mar 23 (The Conversation) With Donald Trump leading in many of the polls for the upcoming US presidential election, his comments about global security and foreign policy have to be taken seriously.\n\nIn February, Trump flippantly remarked that he would encourage Russia to do whatever it wanted to Nato states that failed to pay their bills. In a follow-up interview on GB News this week he warned allies \u201cnot to take advantage\u201d of the US.\n\nNowhere is this causing more concern than for the countries in the Baltic states Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.\n\nNot only does Trump, sometimes, say he wants to halt all US military aid to Ukraine, but Trump wants to undercut article 5 of Nato\u2019s treaty the principle of collective defence something that has become increasingly important in the wake of Russia\u2019s aggression. British military sources are worried that Trump\u2019s remarks will strengthen Putin\u2019s resolve over Ukraine, and could result in him advancing on even more territory.\n\nEven before Trump emerged on the US political scene, the Baltic countries have been especially concerned about Russia\u2019s growing ambitions. They have, after all, been invaded and occupied by Russia before, in 1940, and then forced to become part of the Soviet Union. There\u2019s plenty of people who can still remember life in the Soviet Union.\n\nSince Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea in 2014, the Baltic states have been the loudest voices sounding the alarm about the existential threat posed by Russia, and all three countries increased their military spending to more than 2 per cent of their GDP, and recently agreed to raise it to 3 per cent.\n\nAmid growing security concerns, the defence ministers in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia also agreed in January to set up a common Baltic defence zone on their borders with Russia and Belarus. This would consist of building physical defensive structures such as bunkers.\n\nEstonia will begin construction of 600 bunkers in early 2025. The nations will also cooperate in developing missile artillery, and ensuring that their equipment, ammunition and manpower is updated.\n\nEstonia has also doubled the size of its territorial defence force to 20,000 people, while Latvia reintroduced conscription in 2023 after becoming the only Baltic state to stop mandatory military service in 2006.\n\nLatvia also plans to double the size of its armed forces to 61,000 by the year 2032. Meanwhile, Lithuania has made an agreement with Germany to allow a permanent brigade of 4,800 of its troops to be combat ready on the Russian border by 2027.\n\nBut given that Russia borders 14 countries, why are the Baltic states especially concerned about their security? In addition to being geographically close, a notable number of ethnic Russians live in the Baltic countries (5per cent in Lithuania; 25per cent in Estonia and 36per cent in Latvia. In the eastern Estonian city of Narva, 95.7per cent of the population are native Russian speakers and 87.7per cent are ethnic Russians.\n\nThis matters as Putin has argued that having substantial numbers of ethnic Russians living outside of Russia, due to the \u201ccatastrophic\u201d dissolution of the Soviet Union, represents a \u201chumanitarian disaster of epic proportions\u201d as it left Russians cut off from \u201ctheir motherland\u201d. Putin has vowed to actively protect all \u201cRussians\u201d living abroad.\n\nIn particular, Putin has said he was concerned about how ethnic Russians are being treated in the Baltics, remarking that the deportation of ethnic Russians (most notably in Latvia where there have been recent changes to its immigration laws), poses a threat to Russian national security.\n\nThe Kremlin has also protested the demolition of Soviet monuments in the Baltics, placing Estonia\u2019s prime minster, Kaja Kallas, on its wanted list for doing so.\n\nBut these claims about wanting to protect Russians abroad, are really just a pretext to justify escalation with the Baltics, which will test Nato\u2019s alliance and destabilise the organisation. So it\u2019s not just important that there are ethnic Russians living there there are strategic reasons as well that make them an easy target.\n\nEven with the Baltic countries strengthening their troop numbers, Russia currently has 1.32 million active military personnel, and two million active reserve. Combined this is greater that Lithuania\u2019s entire population of 2.8 million people, and far greater than Estonia and Latvia which have populations of 1.3 million and 1.8 million people, respectively.\n\nFor Lithuania, which borders Belarus and Russian-run mini-state Kaliningrad, there are concerns that it could be taken over first by Russian forces, which would then physically isolate Lithuania from the rest of the Baltics. The Kaliningrad region has become increasingly militarised in recent years, with Iskander ballistic missiles and S-400 systems installed. With Trump suggesting he would weaken the US\u2019s commitment to Nato if elected, there won\u2019t be much of a deterrent for Putin to grab low-hanging fruit.\n\nThe current Nato response force consists of approximately 40,000 troops, with plans to upgrade to 300,000 troops. But quick-reaction units could still be too slow to protect the Baltics from Russian forces as, ironically, moving large units, vehicles and ammunition across borders is bureaucratic and takes time. It would be important to have excellent intelligence and to move quickly, something that will be made more difficult with the US potentially opting out of its commitments.\n\nThough Russia has plunged much of its resources into winning the Ukraine war, Putin still aims to expand Russian sovereignty across the post-Soviet states and to effectively dismantle Nato, something that Trump takes no issue with. As Russia has been ramping up its war machine, the Baltic states firmly believe that Russian aggression will not stop at Ukraine, and that they could be next. (The Conversation)",

            "text": "If anyone is wondering what is the one, sole driving force behind Joe Biden's foreign policy, here is the answer: It's always been about the oil, stupid. Whether it was becoming best friends with the \"evil dictators\" in Iran and Venezuela in hopes of keeping their oil output in the market and depressing the price of the commodity, or enacting purely optical sanctions on Russian oil exports which have led to record oil exports - and export revenues - by the Putin regime, the handlers of the senile president have been terrified of any false move that sharply reduces the supply of oil or its byproducts in the global market, sending commodity prices - and inflation - surging, and crushing Biden's re-election chances.\n\nWhich brings us to the latest surreal news.\n\nRecall that in recent days, Ukraine has taken its drone attack raids deep inside Russian territory, hitting Putin where it hurts, namely bombing one Russian oil refinery after another. Now granted, Ukraine can do far worse and sink Russian oil tankers, but Kiev understands that this would spark outrage at the White House as it would instantly send oil prices surging, although once Trump is in the White House, Ukraine will have no such concerns as we pointed out earlier this week.\n\nUkraine only attacking Russian refineries with drones instead of sinking Russian tankers as that would send oil soaring and would cripple Biden re-election odds.\n\n\n\nOnce Trump wins, Ukraine will go scorched earth on Russian oil infra/tankers. \u2014 zerohedge (@zerohedge) March 17, 2024\n\nHowever, after the onslaught of Ukraine attacks on Russian refineries shut down over 600,000 barrels of Russian daily refining...\n\n... this morning the FT reported what our readers already knew, namely that the Biden admin is freaking out that Ukraine's drone strikes \"risk driving up global oil prices\" which is why Biden has \"urged Ukraine to halt attacks on Russia\u2019s energy infrastructure.\"\n\nAnd it wasn't just once, or twice: the \"repeated warnings\" from Washington were delivered to senior officials at Ukraine\u2019s state security service, the SBU, and its military intelligence directorate, known as the GUR, sources told the Financial Times, as both intelligence units had steadily expanded their own drone programs to strike Russian targets on land, sea and in the air since the start of the Kremlin\u2019s full-scale invasion in February 2022.\n\nOne person said that the White House had grown increasingly frustrated by brazen Ukrainian drone attacks that have struck oil refineries, terminals, depots and storage facilities across western Russia, hurting its oil production capacity as we discussed previously. But what is really being hurt is America's enthusiasm to refill their car after the average gasoline price in the US soared above $3.50, the highest since October and above year-ago levels.\n\nAnd about to go higher...\n\nAs the FT redundantly notes, \"Russia remains one of the world\u2019s most important energy exporters despite western sanctions on its oil and gas sector.\" Of course, the \"despite\" here is a joke: if western sanctions really wanted to halt Russian oil exports they would; instead just like in the case of Ukraine targeting Russian oil infrastructure, \"virtuous\" western leaders are all about \"helping\" Ukraine (of course with your money, dear taxpayers) as long as it does not interfere with their re-election chances. Which means keep any sanctions purely in the optical arena as the alternative is a sharp spike in oil prices. Indeed, oil prices have risen about 15 per cent this year, to $85 a barrel, pushing up fuel costs just as the figurehead in the White House begins his campaign for re-election.\n\nThe White House is also concerned that if Ukraine keeps hitting Russian facilities, including many that are hundreds of miles from the border, Russia could retaliate by lashing out at energy infrastructure relied on by the west. This includes the CPC pipeline carrying oil from Kazakhstan through Russia to the global market. Western companies including ExxonMobil and Chevron use the pipeline, which Moscow briefly shut in 2022.\n\n\u201cWe do not encourage or enable attacks inside of Russia,\u201d an NSC spokesperson said. The CIA declined to comment. In Kyiv, a spokesperson for the SBU declined to comment. Officials at GUR and Zelenskyy\u2019s office did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAs reported previously, Ukraine had stepped up its air attacks in recent weeks, as its drone programs expand and the ground war shifts in Moscow\u2019s favor. It also follows growing discontent in Kyiv over what is seen as the west\u2019s ambivalent approach to curbing Moscow\u2019s energy revenues. Since 2022, there have been at least 12 attacks on major Russian refineries, and at least nine this year, along with several terminals, depots and storage facilities, according to a military intelligence official in Kyiv.\n\nUkraine has steadily increased drone strikes as its technologies have advanced. Ukrainian officials claim to have developed drones with a range in excess of 1,000km and payloads capable of inflicting severe damage. Kyiv launched two of its largest and most widespread drone attacks last week, with operations by both the GUR and SBU successfully targeting seven Russian energy facilities in consecutive days.\n\nOver the past year, GRU and SBU sea drones have also struck Russian ports, destroyed several Russian warships in the Black Sea and hit Moscow\u2019s prized Crimea bridge connecting Russia to the occupied Ukrainian peninsula. The aim of the \u201cspecial operations\u201d is to hamper the supply of fuel to Russia\u2019s troops and cut funding for the Kremlin\u2019s war effort, according to one Ukrainian official involved in planning and conducting the attacks. This is something the West pretended it was doing with \"sanctions\" which turned out to be anything but.\n\nHelima Croft, a former CIA analyst now at RBC Capital Markets, recently noted that Ukraine had shown it could strike most of the oil export infrastructure in western Russia, putting about 60 per cent of the country\u2019s exports at risk.\n\nAfter the Financial Times published news of the US warnings on Friday Olha Stefanishyna, Ukraine\u2019s deputy prime minister for European and Euro-Atlantic integration, was asked how Kyiv had responded to the Biden administration\u2019s appeals to stop attacks on Russian refineries.\n\nShe said: \u201cThe Ukrainian side responded, I think, precisely by achieving its goals and by very successful operations conducted on the territory of the Russian Federation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe understand the appeals of our American partners,\u201d Stefanishyna told an audience at the Kyiv Security Forum. \u201cAt the same time, we are fighting with the capabilities, resources and practices that we have today.\u201d She said energy facilities were legitimate targets from a military point of view, even as the Biden admin clearly disagreed.\n\nIn other words, a defiant Ukraine is now openly biting the hand that feeds it. Which means that Ukraine's attacks on Russian refiners is rapidly emerging as a problem that only such a legendary energy expert as Hunter Biden can solve.\n\n* * * *\n\n\u201cNothing terrifies a sitting American president more than a surge in pump prices during an election year,\u201d said Bob McNally, president of consultancy Rapidan Energy and a former White House energy adviser.\n\nHilariously, while the air campaign is also seen by some officials as a means to spur Washington into approving the $60bn military assistance package held up in Congress that is critical for Ukraine\u2019s defence, what is more likely to happen is that even Biden decides to give more funding to Ukraine which is now using US made weapons to directly reduce his re-election chances.\n\nMeanwhile, over at the \"dovish\" Fed...",

            "text": "While House and Senate conservatives railed against the $1.2 trillion federal funding bill that passed Friday, as the de facto leader of the Republican Party remained silent.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, the GOP\u2019s presumptive 2024 nominee, made no public comments, and his campaign did not respond to multiple requests for comment on the bill, which President Biden signed into law on Saturday.\n\n\u201cThis agreement represents a compromise, which means neither side got everything it wanted,\u201d Biden, a Democrat, said in a statement. \u201cBut it rejects extreme cuts from House Republicans and expands access to child care, invests in cancer research, funds mental health and substance use care, advances American leadership abroad, and provides resources to secure the border that my administration successfully fought to include. That\u2019s good news for the American people.\u201d\n\nCongress avoided a lengthy partial government shutdown Saturday when the Senate passed the spending package 74-24 in the wee hours of the morning. The bill passed the House on Friday by a vote of 286-134, with a majority of Republicans, 113, voting against it.\n\nUS NATIONAL DEBT TRACKER FOR MARCH 22, 2024: SEE WHAT AMERICAN TAXPAYERS (YOU) OWE IN REAL TIME\n\nRepublican opponents seethed as the package moved through Congress, arguing that it did little to address the $34 trillion national debt, funded Biden\u2019s policies that they oppose and failed to include border security enforcement measures that GOP lawmakers had demanded in order to fund the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nThe final vote violated the so-called Hastert Rule, a long held GOP \u201crule,\u201d named after former House Speaker Dennis Hastert, that holds Republican leadership should allow votes only on bills that have a \u201cmajority of the majority\u201d in agreement \u2014 in other words, only if a majority of Republicans support them.\n\nThat outcome reflected deep divisions within the House GOP conference, with many Republicans expressing frustration at leadership for unveiling the 1,012-page package just 48 hours before lawmakers were asked to vote.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s total lack of backbone, total lack of leadership, and a total failure by Republican leadership. There\u2019s no other way to describe it,\u201d Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, said Thursday on former Trump White House adviser Stephen K. Bannon\u2019s \u201cWar Room.\u201d \u201cThis bill is an abomination.\u201d\n\nSENATE PASSES MAMMOTH $1.2T SPENDING PACKAGE AFTER BRIEF PARTIAL GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN\n\nSenate Republicans who opposed the package made similar complaints, with Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah., telling Fox News Digital that it was an \u201cutterly absurd, insulting and lawless suggestion that that is an appropriate legislative process.\u201d\n\nSen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., accused the bill\u2019s supporters of \u201ccaving to Biden & Schumer & voting for billions in earmarks and special interest giveaways,\u201d in a post on X.\n\nGOP firebrand Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., went so far as to introduce a motion to remove House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., from leadership, accusing him of betrayal. Other Republicans, like Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., said that removing Johnson would be a \u201cmistake,\u201d arguing that the speaker has done \u201cthe best he could\u201d with a one-seat majority.\n\nWhile Washington Republicans fight each other, Trump has not yet offered a clear vision for how he would manage these spending crises, were he to win back the White House in 2024.\n\nHOUSE PASSES $1.2 TRILLION GOVERNMENT SPENDING BILL TO AVERT GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN\n\nOn the campaign trail, the presumptive GOP nominee has insisted that he will pay off the national debt if he ousts Biden. But while Trump was president from 2017 through 2020, the laws and executive orders he signed added an estimated $8.4 trillion to the national debt, with interest, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB).\n\nIndeed, Trump was responsible for signing several trillion-dollar omnibus spending bills into law, even before the COVID-19 pandemic. Excluding COVID relief, Trump added $4.8 trillion to the debt over his four years in office, CRFB estimates.\n\nIn his first two years in office, when the House and Senate were in Republican hands, the Trump White House unsuccessfully sought to cut about $15 billion in federal spending with a recissions request. That effort narrowly passed the House and died in the Senate, where Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Richard Burr, R-N.C. sided with Democrats on a procedural vote to kill it.\n\nIn 2018, faced with a $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill, Trump backed down from a veto threat and reluctantly signed the bill, reasoning that it provided needed funds for the military.\n\nBIDEN SAYS $1.2T SPENDING PACKAGE IS \u2018GOOD NEWS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE,\u2019 BUT CONGRESS\u2019 WORK ISN\u2019T OVER\n\n\u201cI say to Congress, I will never sign another bill like this again,\u201d Trump said in remarks after he signed the bill.\n\nThe very next year, Trump signed a $1.4 trillion spending package to avert a partial government shutdown. He did so again as one of his last acts as president in December 2020, putting his signature on another massive $1.4 trillion omnibus that included $900 billion in COVID-19 aid.\n\nBut while Trump did not keep his promise to get federal spending under control in his first term, Biden is on track to exceed Trump\u2019s debt accumulation by the end of this year. In his first three years as president, Biden has added $6.75 trillion to the national debt, according to Treasury Department data. In his final year, the Congressional Budget Office projects a deficit of $1.58 trillion \u2014 which would total $8.3 trillion by the end of Biden\u2019s first term.\n\nThose estimates were made before Biden signed the new $1.2 trillion appropriations package on Saturday.\n\nBiden\u2019s fiscal year 2025 budget calls for $3.3 trillion in net deficit reduction, although the revenue that is needed to achieve that goal would mostly come from tax increases. Biden has promised not to increase taxes on those making less than $400,000, but he otherwise has called for a repeal of Trump\u2019s tax cuts and additional taxes on corporations and the wealthy.\n\nTrump has campaigned on new rounds of tax cuts, arguing that economic growth stimulated by lower taxes will make up for any loss in government revenue. But he has yet to tell voters how he plans to cut spending, or how he will work with Congress to break the cycle of last-minute omnibus spending bills that were characteristic of his first term.",

            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe Democratic Party has ramped up its attacks on independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in recent days, marking the first significant attempt by either party to shape voter sentiment around his candidacy ahead of a potential rematch of the 2020 election.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee has taken multiple steps in recent days to portray Kennedy as a spoiler who would help Republican frontrunner Donald Trump defeat President Joe Biden, arguing Kennedy is funded primarily by wealthy donors aligned with the former president.\n\nLast week, the DNC filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission alleging that Kennedy\u2019s campaign had illegally coordinated with American Values 2024, a PAC backing his White House bid. Kennedy\u2019s campaign has denied coordinating with the group.\n\nIn a call with reporters outlining the complaint, DNC adviser Ramsey Reid blamed Trump and his donors for turning Kennedy into a \u201cstalking horse\u201d by funding the PAC.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re concerned that Donald Trump is disrespecting the democratic process. It\u2019s pretty clear that Trump and his megadonors are propping up RFK Jr. as a stalking horse,\u201d Reid said.\n\nThe DNC has homed in on donations to the PAC from billionaire Tim Mellon, an heir to a prominent banking fortune who has been a prolific donor to pro-Trump and other GOP causes over the years. Mellon gave approximately $15 million to American Values 2024 last year. In 2020, he gave $20 million to America First Action Inc., one of the leading outside groups backing Trump\u2019s reelection.\n\nOn Saturday, as Kennedy held a campaign rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan, the DNC advertised on four billboards around the area accusing Kennedy of being \u201cpowered by MAGA/Trump.\u201d And after the Kennedy-aligned PAC released a new TV ad during the Super Bowl that repurposed an old spot from the 1960 campaign of President John F. Kennedy, the candidate\u2019s uncle, the DNC issued a statement highlighting the PAC\u2019s funding from Mellon.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fitting that the first national ad promoting Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s candidacy was bought and paid for by Donald Trump\u2019s largest donor this cycle,\u201d DNC rapid response director Alex Floyd said in a statement released shortly after the ad aired Sunday.\n\nKennedy\u2019s team pushed back on the Democratic attacks, saying that donors \u201cfrom across the political spectrum are supporting the Kennedy campaign as they are tired of the corruption in the two-party system.\u201d\n\n\u201cInstead, donors want an independent candidate who will heal the divide, restore the middle class, end the forever wars, unravel corporate capture, and the end chronic disease epidemic,\u201d Kennedy campaign spokeswoman Stefanie Spear said in a statement to CNN.\n\nDNC adviser Lis Smith told CNN the party\u2019s latest efforts are meant to educate voters on the connections between Trump and Kennedy, while acknowledging the critical role Kennedy could play in the general election.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that Donald Trump and his allies view him as a useful stalking horse who could help throw the election to Trump in November,\u201d Smith said.\n\nWhile his independent campaign faces steep odds of success, Kennedy\u2019s candidacy could influence the outcome of a Biden-Trump rematch if he garners enough support in critical states. In the 2020 election, Biden flipped three states \u2013 Arizona, Georgia and Wisconsin \u2013 by margins of less than 1%. Recent national polling of a Trump-Biden rematch suggests the race could be narrowly decided again. A CNN/SSRS poll released earlier this month showed Trump with 49% support among registered voters, compared with 45% for Biden.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear as of now how Kennedy would affect a potential general election between Biden and Trump \u2013 whether he\u2019d draw more support from historically Republican or Democratic voters, or whether he\u2019d receive enough total support to influence the election either way. An NBC News poll released this month found 34% of registered voters saying they could see themselves supporting Kennedy.\n\nBut Kennedy\u2019s allies have targeted Biden and Democrats as they look to gain traction in the race, a sign they\u2019re ready to meet the DNC\u2019s escalating attacks straight ahead. In a statement released after the Super Bowl ad, American Values 2024 co-founder Mark Gorton criticized the DNC for its efforts targeting Kennedy.\n\n\u201cThe only argument the DNC has left is that Biden is not Trump. When RFK Jr. gets on the ballot, the American public will have the ability to choose a candidate who is not Trump, who has integrity, bravery, a proven track record of fighting corporate corruption, and the ability to stand up to the corporate interests that have taken over the Biden administration. The American people are waking up, and the DNC\u2019s only hope is to prevent them from having a choice,\u201d Gorton said.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\n\nCNN\u2019s Edward-Isaac Dovere and David Wright contributed to this report.",

Protests are underway in cities across the country over the death of George Floyd, who died on May 25 in police custody in Minneapolis. (Photo: Eze Amos/Getty Images)\n\nEquipping police departments with military-grade equipment doesn\u2019t reduce crime or increase safety, in accordance with two independent studies. The research is a component of the continued discussion concerning the validity of \u201cdefunding the police\u201d as a method.\n\nIN \u201cPolice demilitarization and violent crime\u201cKenneth Lowande, a professor on the University of Michigan, disputes claims that the military weapons exchange program has reduced crime rates, assaults on police officers and the variety of complaints against police officers.\n\nFinding errors in previously published data, Lowande focused on data available after the Obama administration\u2019s 2015 order to demilitarize local police agencies. In response to public outrage over the display of militarized police in Ferguson, the Obama administration he banned some selling military equipment to police under the controversial 1033 program. The Trump administration modified this policy in 2017.\n\nIN interview on ABC News, Lowande explained that previous research has shown that providing military equipment to police departments has a deterrent effect on crime. However, his evaluation shows that the evidence doesn\u2019t support such conclusions. \u201cIt\u2019s just not an accurate record,\u201d Lowande said. \u201c[Prior studies] clearly suggested that giving military equipment to police departments would deter criminals from committing crimes.\u201d\n\nThe research, published within the London-based journal Nature of Human Behavior, highlights that the Trump administration relied on potentially \u201cunreliable\u201d data in deciding to repeal Obama-era restrictions. Based on an assessment of previous studies, Lowande concluded that the publicly available data utilized in previous studies was riddled with inaccuracies. Previous analyzes didn\u2019t include equipment that was transferred between agencies, unused, or otherwise inoperable. Lowande also found no evidence that demilitarizing law enforcement led to an increase in crime.\n\nThe 1033 program, administered by the Defense Logistics Agency, is one among several ways law enforcement agencies acquire military equipment. Created in 1997 as a part of the National Defense Authorization Act, is estimated The 1033 program distributed greater than $7 billion in military equipment to eight,000 law enforcement agencies across the country. The program was originally created for \u201ccounter-terrorism\u201d forces, but was later expanded to cover all law enforcement activities.\n\nCoinciding with nationwide uprisings this summer, several House members introduced laws in June to eliminate the 1033 program. The Movement for Black Lives also released the BREATHE Act, a comprehensive legislative proposal that features funding for specific policies and abolishing the police. Section I of the proposed BREATHE ACT calls for the whole repeal of the 1033 program.",

They say Israel is \u201cpursuing its legitimate goals by legitimate means.\u201d Well, I and much of the world dispute that.\n\nKilling every single, solitary Hamas fighter who ever lived, no matter where they are and no matter how many civilians get in the way, is not legitimate. Leveling three-quarters of the buildings in Gaza and causing death to women and children is not legitimate. Destroying hospitals and schools and causing famine and disease is not legitimate. Displacing more than 1.5 million people from their homes and forcing them to live on the streets in tents is not legitimate. Shutting off water, electricity and sewage treatment is not legitimate. Inhibiting the movement of humanitarian aid is not legitimate.\n\nDestroying Hamas\u2019 capability of ever attacking Israel again like it did on Oct. 7 is legitimate, and that goal was achieved months ago. How will Hamas ever repeat such an attack on Israel? Will they gather in the open in flattened former neighborhoods, march undetected to Israel and attack while Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s IDF is on another 14-hour vacation?\n\nHamas is no longer a threat to Israel. If they are, please detail how and under what circumstances they can attack Israel again. If you can not, then you agree that Israel has already won and it is time to stop. Steven Davies\n\nField report\n\nForest Hills: Do Israel\u2019s cheerleaders in America bother following Israeli media before dutifully spouting government propaganda? Bibi Netanyahu claims the IDF must invade Rafah to \u201cfinish\u201d Hamas. Then why did the chief officer of the Israeli special forces Commando Brigade, Omer Cohen, say this recently after pulling out of the Hamad Town neighborhood in Khan Younis, which Israeli airstrikes destroyed back in early December: \u201cWe experienced combat here in Hamad Town the likes of which we have not seen anywhere else in Gaza \u2014 advanced combat units with clear command structure.\u201d That means Bibi\u2019s onslaught has failed to cripple Hamas, as many have warned throughout this savagery. There is no military solution to a militant movement that exists solely in response to generations of militaristic oppression. It also means Bibi\u2019s aim is to \u201cfinish\u201d Gaza, as Rafah is the last area not largely obliterated. This is a genocide to destroy Gaza, not Hamas.

You would think that in an election year, Congress would be eager to pass a tax cut for families (and small businesses). But a few senators are blocking it for political gain. Families should not have to wait months for Congress to pass something that is popular and necessary. It is time for senators to show us their hands. If the bill passes, families win.

Rent, groceries and cost of living are at an all-time high. Students are struggling to put food on the table, and living in these conditions can make it difficult to ask for help. For many, food insecurity comes with shame and embarrassment. The Hunger-Free Campus Act addresses food insecurity in private and public institutions. It would provide resources, such as grants to target food insecurity, and assist with housing displacement support. In New York, this act has just been introduced. We need to urge Assembly members to promote this law for the sake of our students \u2014 in other words, for the sake of our future. We can not expect students to excel in academics if they cannot afford basic human needs. Laura Yusupova",

            "text": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. Although many Americans and policy wonks see climate change as the major existential issue of our time, it ends up feeling like a relatively small piece of the American political conversation, which is more focused on the economy, immigration and democracy. The climate crisis ends up touching on all of those issues, as CNN\u2019s chief climate correspondent Bill Weir told me. His new book, \u201cLife As We Know It (Can Be): Stories of People, Climate and Hope in a Changing World,\u201d comes out on April 16. We talked on the phone about his recent trip to Massachusetts, where some beachfront homeowners who want the state to do more to help protect the area from erosion and rising sea levels also deny the climate is in crisis. My conversation with Weir, edited for clarity, is below: WOLF: You\u2019re on the ground covering the climate crisis every day. Where has that taken you recently? WEIR: To both ends of the spectrum. It\u2019s the grim reality of what\u2019s unfolding and also, we\u2019re working on a special on innovation. Most recently, I was in Salisbury, Massachusetts, on the New Hampshire border where folks there, over the generations, have watched the high tide get higher, year by year. As is the case along the Atlantic coast, erosion is accelerating along with sea level rise. And so this year, over 100 homeowners banded together, spent $600,000 on 15,000 tons of sand in order to fortify their beachside homes from storms and higher tides. In years past, that would last them three or four years, but then they got yet another freak storm and high tide and most of it was washed away in a single day. They\u2019re coming to grips in various forms with the five stages of climate grief. They very much want the state to kick in. I met some neighbors who refuse to acknowledge climate science and just believe that this is a string of bad luck, a one-off series of unfortunate events. Others are coming around to the to the idea and the actual scientific warnings that Massachusetts is bracing for, officially, a couple of feet of sea level rise above year 2000 levels just in the next decade or two. This $600k defense against sea level rise could have lasted 3 years. It was destroyed in less than a day This was a fascinating case study in the psychology about it, and how people who don\u2019t really acknowledge the warnings of science are the ones most dedicated to saving what\u2019s there now, and so are a vital part of bracing for what\u2019s unfolding. And at the other end of the spectrum?\n\nWEIR: I went down to Florida and met with a couple of inspirational developers. One is Syd Kitson, a former NFL player, who built the first solar power town in America. It\u2019s called Babcock Ranch, Florida. I was riding out Hurricane Ian a few miles away where everything was plunged into darkness and flooded. But because of his designs and ideas, they never lost power and never flooded, and as a result, the demand for people to buy homes in Babcock Ranch has skyrocketed. He\u2019s building them as fast as he can. And so I\u2019m looking at glimpses into how the climate crisis is already changing neighborhoods and which direction we\u2019re likely to go when it comes to construction and food supplies and energy. It\u2019s all changing incredibly fast \u2013 an industrial revolution that nobody\u2019s talking about. See why this Florida town survived Ian unscathed WOLF: You did another story recently about Buffalo as a landing spot for climate refugees. I think it\u2019s interesting that on the one hand, you\u2019re talking to people who are making it so that we can withstand climate change in Florida, but then also thinking about where people are eventually going to have to move because of climate change. How far out is the horizon where we actually see people moving away from the Sunbelt because that\u2019s where people have been moving to for so long? This city rarely reaches 100 degrees. It is now considered a \u2018climate refuge\u2019 WEIR: It\u2019s a fascinating question for different reasons. Five thousand people who were driven out of Puerto Rico by Hurricane Maria went to Buffalo for refuge because there\u2019s a Puerto Rican community there; 3,000 of them stayed. The city embraced that. They need folks to revitalize these Rust Belt towns, and they have a ton of fresh water and clean energy with Niagara Falls. So they\u2019ve declared themselves a climate refuge. For them, it\u2019s not just the latitude, it\u2019s the attitude around migration. At the same time, for the first time in human history, sun and wind energy are the cheapest forms of energy. And so the sun belts, now we\u2019re gonna think of them as the solar belts, and the wind belts, the high plains of Texas, are going to be a huge magnet for big manufacturing who need a lot of abundant energy. Texas now leads the nation in clean energy just because of the economics, despite the politics and ideology. Bright-red Texas is the greenest state right now. The math, the economics of it, is going to change the landscape of what attracts companies, and then as a result, what attracts workers. But ultimately, the heat is going to win. As the belly on the planet becomes more intolerable, the northern latitudes become that much more attractive. Alaska could be the new Florida for retirees. It\u2019ll be a lot wetter up there. But the band of the United States from Portland, Maine, to Portland, Oregon, across the Great Lakes is a refuge that is best positioned for that. The UN predicts tens of millions of folks forced to cross borders by sudden, unnatural disasters. You can see what\u2019s happening on the border now. And as droughts get worse in Central America, you can just play it out. The strain is going to go up. WOLF: It\u2019s interesting to hear you say that about Texas, because the governor and the Republican-dominated legislature there would seemingly be opposed to doing anything specifically because of climate change. But if there\u2019s a capitalist urge, people seem more in tune with it. Joe Biden has tried to make the argument that addressing climate change should be an economic boom. Do you think that even if people are unwilling to accept that climate change is happening, they still might be doing things to address it? WEIR: Oh, absolutely. A story that I don\u2019t get to tell enough is just this massive boom in renewables and clean energy and clean water tech. I think the most recent analysis was for every dollar spent by the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act, five-and-a-half bucks in private investment has chased that. And there are these massive growth rates in the sectors that people aren\u2019t talking about \u2013 carbon removal, thermal storage, using big boxes of hot rocks to store clean energy, using the earth as a battery through pressure, geothermal \u2013 all of these things are exploding now. Scientists have a way of removing carbon dioxide from our oceans\n\nAt the same time, the United States is the biggest petrostate in human history. Joe Biden has exported much more fossil fuels than Donald Trump. It\u2019s the result of this big boom in fracked natural gas. That\u2019s a big sticking point with the environmental wing of his base.\n\nThe big question is how much this new energy boom replaces the old, dirty kind of energy or if we just are so ravenous in our appetites; humanity never cuts back.\n\nIn places like Charleston (South Carolina), where they\u2019re building a billion dollar seawall, and people are raising their 100-year-old mansions on the Battery, it\u2019s not a political debate. It is reality. The physics are right there in your face.\n\nMatt Yglesias is among others who have said we shouldn\u2019t talk too much about climate at all. Because the average person, when it comes to actual action, daily action, doesn\u2019t really want to do it.\n\nWOLF: I\u2019ve wondered about that with regard to electric vehicles. It seems like some people are turned off by them because it\u2019s making a political statement when you buy an EV instead of simply trying to get the best deal.\n\nWEIR: I think what you\u2019re seeing now is there\u2019s been such sudden market saturation that now there\u2019s a backlash, there\u2019s a glut or an oversupply.\n\nThese things happen in fits and starts. Offshore wind was super exciting. And then it hit inflation headwinds and supply chain problems. EVs were a novelty and a statement. And now there\u2019s a tyranny of choice. There\u2019s so many different models and sorting out all the incentives is still not easy.\n\nAt the same time, we\u2019ve crossed the point that I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going back to the internal combustion engine, as a species, the same way there was a certain point we weren\u2019t going back to horses. It just makes more sense.\n\nElectrifying everything is the ultimate result, I think, of all this. It\u2019s just a matter of how fast it takes.\n\nLook at these S-shaped curves of adaptation in history from the color television to the refrigerator that went from, you know, 10% of homes to 95% in a relatively short amount of time. We\u2019ve seen that same thing with solar and battery storage, the same kind of thing with heat pumps. And there\u2019s a big wave of efficiency and cleaner, more sustainable choices coming, regardless of the politics.\n\nWOLF: I read in CNN\u2019s report that it was the warmest winter on record and that the planet was more than 2 degrees over the pre-industrial levels for a number of days in February. It seems clear that we\u2019re going to burst through the 2-degree tipping point that had been previously suggested as the tipping point for climate change. What is the next marker?\n\nWEIR: The hardest thing for most folks to grasp \u2013 I still have a hard time grasping it even though I live in the space every day \u2013 is that the record-shattering year that we just had isn\u2019t just the hottest year in 120,000 years or so. It\u2019s among the coolest years of the rest of our lives.\n\nAnd there has been no meaningful reduction in emissions. The human hand on the global thermostat still has it cranked all the way up. And until that changes, until the atmosphere stabilizes at a certain rate, it\u2019s just going to keep getting warmer.\n\nThe really scary stuff is what we don\u2019t see and what\u2019s much harder to measure and to communicate, which is that the ocean temperatures have broken a record every day for the last year.\n\nEvery new day on the calendar is the hottest such day that we\u2019ve ever recorded. What that means for marine ecosystems and coral reefs, which are the cradles of life in the oceans, and what it means for the power of storms as we head into hurricane season has scientists really, really worried.\n\nWOLF: What are the little things that people should be doing? I don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s realistically asking people to stop travel completely. You travel to cover these stories. How do you layer the climate into your daily life?\n\nWEIR: When you take on this beat, you see everything in life differently. I used to just see an ice cream truck and smile. Now I see the fumes coming off the generator. I think about the sugarcane fields that burn to make delicious treats. Everything has a cost if you really think about it.\n\nI absolutely think about my flight footprint and for years would offset my air miles with clean energy projects that are vetted, charities I believe in.\n\nBut we can\u2019t offset our way out of this problem. We have to come up with a way to fly sustainably, and we have to figure out a way to build our homes and source our food and make our clothing in much more efficient and sensible ways.\n\nOn the personal responsibility part of it, I do my best. I haven\u2019t owned a car in a few years. I\u2019m proud to say I have almost 4,000 miles on Citi Bikes (New York\u2019s bike-share service), but I just like riding a bike. I\u2019m not doing that to be some sort of Captain Planet statement maker; I just liked that way of getting around New York City. If I lived in Dallas or Chicago, it probably wouldn\u2019t work.\n\nPersonal choices are important because they\u2019re an extension of our awareness of the problem of what\u2019s in our air, what\u2019s in our water, what our energy mix means for life as we know it and what it will mean for generations to come.\n\nWhat everybody chooses to do with that is important, but what is hugely important is talking about it. Letting it inform your choices as a consumer and a voter for sure. But also realizing that the decision-makers who work in C-suites of the biggest petrochemical companies, the biggest fossil fuel legacy companies in the world \u2013 you could fit all of them in a couple of Greyhound buses.\n\nRight now, governments are subsidizing fossil fuel. They\u2019re paying companies to uncork the Godzilla that is changing weather in horrible ways. So until massive systems change, the best you can do as a consumer is just be aware and talk about it.\n\nWOLF: That\u2019s kind of depressing. What am I missing?\n\nWEIR: There\u2019s a couple of things that I like to point out. In 2022, if you asked the average American to guess how many of their fellow countrymen and women both understand the climate crisis and are supportive of meaningful action, the average response was 33% to 40%, regardless of party. In reality, it is like 66% to 80%.\n\nThe authors of the paper call it \u201cpluralistic ignorance.\u201d If you care about an Earth in balance, you think you\u2019re outnumbered two to one, when the opposite is true.\n\nPeople are surrounded by allies they didn\u2019t know they had. People also underestimate how quickly nature can heal itself if given a chance and how quickly systems can adjust when people work together.\n\nThe pandemic taught us a lot of lessons, but it also produced a number of vaccines in record time when everyone was focused on one mission. So there\u2019s a lot of room for despair. But there\u2019s so many reasons for hope, and it\u2019s just really about the stories we tell around this topic.",

When he introduced his presidential run in 2015, he pledged to self-finance his marketing campaign and crowed, \u201cI don\u2019t want anyone\u2019s cash.\u201d President Biden\u2019s reelection marketing campaign reported Wednesday that it has $71 million in money available \u2014 greater than double the $33.5 million that Trump\u2019s marketing campaign reported having. In case you throw within the financial institution balances of affiliated teams supporting the candidates, Trump\u2019s marketing campaign liquidity rises to $42 million \u2014 however Biden\u2019s soars to a surprising $155 million, a ridiculous quantity for this level within the cycle.\n\nIt makes me marvel about all these tales telling us how unenthusiastic Democrats are about Biden\u2019s reelection.

It reported elevating $10.7 million in February, ending the month with $11.3 million within the financial institution.

These families deserve justice, not prosecution and persecution.\"\n\nAccording to National Review, a number of Gold Star families attended the Foreign Affairs Committee hearing on Tuesday, which examined the Biden's administration's failures in withdrawing from Afghanistan and featured testimony from former Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley and U.S. Central Command retired Gen. Frank McKenzie.\n\nNikoui previously said that it was \"devastating\" to hear Biden mention slain Georgia nursing student Laken Riley at the State of the Union, given the fact that the president has never mentioned his son and the others who were killed in Afghanistan.\n\n\"I was just strongly convicted by the Holy Spirit to stand up and say that after sitting there for almost an hour of just total disrespect to us,\" Nikoui said. \"He knew that there were other Gold Star family members. He could have at least just said their names and this would have been done.'\"",

            "text": "Maria Korneeva | Moment | Getty Images\n\nThe Biden administration has set a key deadline for student loan borrowers hoping to get forgiveness. Those with multiple federal student loans who request a consolidation by April 30 \u2014 which will leave them with one, larger loan \u2014 could benefit from the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s overhaul of income-driven repayment plans. Those changes have already led to debt cancelation for more than 930,000 people and $45 billion in relief. \u201cThe opportunity to consolidate loans will help many more borrowers to qualify for student loan forgiveness,\u201d said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. Here\u2019s what to know about the deadline.\n\nConsolidation can get you closer to loan forgiveness\n\nIncome-driven repayment plans, which date to 1994, set borrowers\u2019 monthly payments based on a share of their discretionary income. Those payments are typically lower than under standard repayment, and can be zero under some plans. Borrowers typically get any remaining debt forgiven after 10, 20 or 25 years, depending on the plan. One complicating factor for borrowers in these programs is that they often have multiple loans, taken out at different times, Kantrowitz said. \u201cThey get at least one new loan each year in school, on average,\u201d he said. That can mean a borrower has multiple timelines to forgiveness, one for each of those loans. More from Personal Finance:\n\nFAFSA fiasco may cause drop in college enrollment, experts say\n\nHarvard is back on top as the ultimate \u2018dream\u2019 school\n\nMore of the nation\u2019s top colleges roll out no-loan policies Now, the Biden administration is temporarily offering borrowers the chance to combine their loans and to get credit going back as far as their first loan payment on the oldest of their original loans in that bundle. For example, say a borrower graduated from college in 2004, took out more loans for a graduate degree in 2018 and is now in repayment under an income-driven plan with a 20-year timeline to forgiveness. Consolidating could lead them to immediately qualify for forgiveness on all of those loans, experts say. In normal times, consolidating your student loans can be a terrible move for those hoping to get rid of their debt as your forgiveness timeline is restarted. But the Biden administration has changed that program detail through April 30.\n\nWhat to know about consolidating your student loans\n\nAll federal student loans are eligible for consolidation, including Federal Family Education Loans, Parent Plus loans and Perkins Loans, Kantrowitz said. You can apply for a Direct Consolidation Loan at StudentAid.gov or with your loan servicer. \u201cSo long as the application is submitted by April 30, they should be fine, even if the servicers takes longer to process it,\u201d Kantrowitz said.\n\nSome borrowers who took out small amounts may even be eligible for cancelation after as few as 10 years\u2019 worth of payments, if they enroll in the new income-driven repayment option, known as the SAVE plan. Consolidating your loans shouldn\u2019t increase your monthly payment, since your bill under an income-driven repayment plan is based on your earnings and not your total debt, Kantrowitz said. Your new interest rate will be a weighted average of the rates across your loans.",

            "text": "Washington CNN \u2014\n\nPresident Donald Trump has ordered staff to execute the \u201cfull\u201d and \u201crapid\u201d withdrawal of US military from Syria, declaring that the US has defeated ISIS.\n\n\u201cWe have defeated ISIS in Syria, my only reason for being there during the Trump Presidency,\u201d Trump tweeted Wednesday morning. Planning for the pullout is already underway, a US defense official and an administration official told CNN.\n\nThe decision, a sharp reversal from previously stated US policy, surprised foreign allies and lawmakers, sparking rebukes, rebuttals and warnings of intensified congressional oversight, even as the White House said troops are already on their way home.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty annoyed,\u201d said Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and Trump ally, who told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju the President\u2019s decision was \u201cObama-like\u201d \u2013 a reference to President Barack Obama\u2019s decision to pull troops out of Iraq in 2011, which critics say gave rise to ISIS. Graham said the role of Congress is \u201cto make administrations explain their policy, not in a tweet, but before Congress answering questions.\u201d\n\n\u2018Betrayed\u2019\n\nThe President\u2019s decision flew in the face of policy statements by administration officials just days earlier and military statements about the threat of ISIS, highlighting the continuing dysfunction at the most senior levels of Trump\u2019s administration.\n\nEven though the US will continue to maintain troops in Iraq with the capability of launching strikes into Syria, many analysts said a withdrawal of ground forces will please US enemies by clearing the way in Syria for the Assad regime, Russia and Iran. A US departure could leave allies questioning Washington\u2019s commitment, reduce US awareness of dynamics on the ground and diminish Washington\u2019s influence in the region.\n\nIt is \u201cextraordinarily shortsighted and naive,\u201d said Charles Lister, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, who added that the decision will not only leave Iran hawks \u2013 including lawmakers and Cabinet members such as national security adviser John Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo \u2013 feeling \u201cbetrayed,\u201d but also plant the seeds for rebellion among Republican ranks.\n\n\u201cThis is a specifically Trumpian decision, and one that will be deeply unpopular within the vast majority of the GOP\u2019s foreign policy machine,\u201d Lister said. \u201cWhether it takes hours or months, we will see some serious resistance coming out of this.\u201d\n\nThe fallout for Iran policy will be significant, said Derek Chollet, a US assistant secretary of defense in the Obama administration and now an executive vice president at the German Marshall Fund. \u201cThis drives a stake into the heart of the administration\u2019s Iran strategy.\u201d\n\nIgnoring the lesson\n\nVideo Ad Feedback GOP senators give Pence 'earful' on Syria 03:11 - Source: CNN\n\nThe churn in the administration\u2019s foreign policy echoes \u2013 and may be designed to distract from \u2013 major upheaval on the domestic front, as Trump contends with criminal investigations into his campaign, transition, inaugural committee and presidency, the dissolution of his charity amid charges he used it to enrich himself and his former national security adviser Michael Flynn awaiting sentencing after lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russian officials.\n\nWhile Trump repeatedly returned to the idea of pulling troops out of Syria on the campaign trail and in office, the move is hard to square with his other policy priorities or his past criticism of Obama.\n\n\u201cTrump himself said on the campaign trail that he may not have liked being in Iraq, but Obama ruined a lot by pulling out too early and not thinking about what would happen next,\u201d said David Adesnik, the director of research and a Syria analyst at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. \u201cHere he is ignoring precisely that lesson.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery indicator that would tell you this is a premature withdrawal is back again,\u201d Adesnik added.\n\nLister said it was \u201cextraordinary to see (Trump) repeating the same mistake and I actually think this could be worse,\u201d as Syria is in far worse shape than Iraq had been.\n\nAllies blindsided\n\nUS allies in the region were blindsided by the announcement. Two diplomatic sources from two countries in the region said they had not been consulted or informed and that news of the planned withdrawal came as a \u201ctotal surprise.\u201d\n\nTobias Ellwood, a minister in the British Ministry of Defense, said in a tweet that he \u201cstrongly\u201d disagrees with Trump\u2019s comment on Wednesday that ISIS had been defeated. \u201cIt has morphed into other forms of extremism and the threat is very much alive,\u201d Ellwood wrote, while the Defense Ministry told CNN there would be no immediate change to its current operation in Syria.\n\nAccording to a statement from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office, Trump informed Netanyahu on Monday of his decision. Netanyahu also had a conversation Tuesday with Pompeo. The two men reassured the Prime Minister that the US had \u201cother ways of expressing their influence in the area,\u201d the statement added.\n\nIran is Israel\u2019s central concern. In September, Bolton said the United States wouldn\u2019t leave Syria as long as Iranian forces continued to operate there, directly linking any withdrawal of American troops to the departure of Iranian forces.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to leave as long as Iranian troops are outside Iranian borders, and that includes Iranian proxies and militias,\u201d Bolton said at the time.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a big reversal\u2019\n\nAsked if Wednesday\u2019s announcement meant that threat no longer exists, a White House official who declined to be identified publicly told CNN, \u201cUS forces will continue the fight against ISIS. We will continue to use tools of national power, including economic sanctions and diplomatic pressure, as leverage to press for the withdrawal of Iranian-backed forces.\u201d\n\nBut the administration\u2019s ability to push back on Iran \u2013 a major foreign policy priority \u2013 will take a hit because of Trump\u2019s decision, Adesnik said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big reversal,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cWe have announced a policy of pushing back against Iran\u2019s nuclear violations and aggression in the region on every front. And Syria is an absolutely central front for Iran; for them it\u2019s an indispensable ally.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t have a counter Iran strategy if you just hand Syria back to them,\u201d Adesnik said, \u201cand it\u2019s not clear to me if this withdrawal in any way accounts for that.\u201d\n\nLister said it amounts to giving up \u201call leverage and as part of a regional strategy of containing Iran, all of that becomes a joke. We\u2019ve just told Iran and all of our regional allies we don\u2019t believe in sticking it out to achieve our foreign policy objectives.\u201d\n\n\u201cIran will take this as a huge vote of confidence,\u201d he said.\n\nTroops on the ground\n\nVideo Ad Feedback U.S. preparing for \"full\" and \"rapid\" withdrawal from Syria 08:09 - Source: CNN\n\nThe US has about 2,000 troops in Syria, where they are primarily training local forces to combat ISIS. The US-backed and Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces have had some recent success against the terror group and are on the cusp of capturing the last major town held by ISIS east of the Euphrates.\n\n\u201cFive years ago, ISIS was a very powerful and dangerous force in the Middle East, and now the United States has defeated the territorial caliphate,\u201d White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe have started returning United States troops home as we transition to the next phase of this campaign,\u201d she said, adding that the US victories didn\u2019t signal an end of the global coalition on ISIS or its campaign.\n\nEstimates vary as to how many ISIS fighters are left in Syria, but Lister noted that \u201cwe\u2019re arguably years from achieving\u201d a defeat of ISIS.\n\n\u201cTo make that fact as clear as day,\u201d he said, only 10 minutes before Trump sent his Wednesday tweet, \u201cISIS claimed responsibility for an attack in Raqqa,\u201d a town the US had liberated and where US troops and US Agency for International Development and State Department personnel are deployed.\n\nThreading the needle\n\nThe anti-ISIS coalition has estimated there are some 2,000 ISIS fighters in the town of Hajin, the terror group\u2019s last redoubt. But a Defense Department inspector general report put the number of ISIS members in Syria and Iraq as high as 30,000.\n\nGen. Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said this month that the US needed to train thousands of local fighters to ensure a lasting defeat of the terror group\n\nThe chief Pentagon spokesperson, Dana W. White, tried to thread the needle. \u201cThe Coalition has liberated the ISIS-held territory, but the campaign against ISIS is not over,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cWe have started the process of returning U.S. troops home from Syria as we transition to the next phase of the campaign. We will continue working with our partners and allies to defeat ISIS wherever it operates.\u201d\n\nFor force protection and operational security reasons, White said the Pentagon would not provide further details. A State Department spokesperson, speaking on background, said that for operational security reasons the department would have no comment on the movement of agency personnel.\n\nThis story has been updated.",

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., engaged in a tense exchange with a witness, highlighting the escalating political tension surrounding the proceedings.\n\nIn a charged moment, Rep. Ocasio-Cortez questioned Tony Bobulinski, a former associate of the president\u2019s son Hunter, pressing him to specify any crimes he witnessed President Biden commit. The congresswoman interrupted Bobulinski\u2019s response, demanding concrete examples of alleged wrongdoing.\n\nThe exchange intensified when Bobulinski referenced the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), prompting Rep. Ocasio-Cortez to correct him, emphasizing that RICO is a legal category, not a crime itself.\n\nAmidst the heated dialogue, Rep. Ocasio-Cortez criticized the impeachment inquiry\u2019s foundation, asserting that House Republicans have failed to substantiate claims of \u201chigh crimes,\u201d a prerequisite for impeachment. She questioned the committee\u2019s persistence in pursuing what she deemed \u201cfalse charges.\u201d\n\nThe backdrop of the impeachment inquiry against President Biden comes amidst broader political dynamics, including tensions within the Democratic Party. Rep. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s stance reflects a delicate balance between moderate Democrats supporting Biden and progressive factions expressing discontent, particularly regarding Biden\u2019s approach to the Gaza conflict\n\n.While Rep. Ocasio-Cortez has taken steps to align with progressive voices, such as wearing a pin symbolizing solidarity with Palestine during Biden\u2019s State of the Union address, her actions also demonstrate a nuanced approach aimed at maintaining cohesion within the Democratic Party.\n\nThe clash underscores the deepening polarization within American politics and the ongoing struggle to navigate contentious issues at the intersection of law, politics, and ideology. As the impeachment inquiry unfolds, it remains to be seen how such confrontations will shape the broader political landscape leading up to the next election cycle.\n\nAbout The Author\n\nRelated",

The national appeal aims to \u201cmobilize supporters and volunteers around defending the ACA from Trump\u2019s attacks,\u201d the campaign said.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee is also running digital battleground ads criticizing Trump for his efforts to repeal the ACA.\n\nAds will appear as digital front pages on local newspaper websites in Pennsylvania, Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina, Georgia, Michigan and Wisconsin.\n\nThe Biden campaign and Democratic allies enthusiastically jumped into battle with Trump over ObamaCare after the presumptive GOP nominee emerged seeking to repeal the law.\n\nMore than 40 million people have health insurance through ObamaCare, and the law is more popular than ever. Biden campaign officials see keeping it as a major political issue as enrollments for coverage in 2024 hit a record 21.3 million.\n\nBiden and Democrats have long seen health care as a winning issue for them, and the president has targeted the pocketbook issue to cut people\u2019s costs amid broad concerns about the economy.\n\n\u201cWe cannot take this progress for granted.

FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Joe Biden speaks, as he announces a preliminary agreement with Intel for a major CHIPS and Science Act award, during a visit to the Intel Ocotillo Campus, in Chandler, Arizona, U.S., March 20, 2024. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque/File\n\n\n\n2/2\n\nBy Valerie Volcovici\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) \u2013 The Biden administration says its recent decision to scale back new climate regulations meant to force emissions cuts from cars and power plants will have a negligible impact on its overarching goal to halve greenhouse gas pollution this decade.\n\nBut whether that is true hinges on whether the U.S. succeeds in its parallel strategy \u2013 to use lucrative taxpayer subsidies to fuel a massive deployment of solar, wind and other renewable energy installations that Biden hopes will ultimately power America\u2019s fleet of electric vehicles, along with its homes and businesses, according to researchers.\n\n\u201cI think it will require an extraordinary, coordinated effort to meet the clean energy share that is necessary to hit the (U.S. target),\u201d said Mike O\u2019Boyle, senior director for electricity at research firm Energy Innovation.\n\nThe United States is the world\u2019s biggest historical emitter of carbon dioxide and President Joe Biden has promised the international community that it will push hard to decarbonize as part of global efforts to fight climate change, using a combination of regulation and subsidies.\n\nBut the recent decisions by his administration to ease auto emissions standards and to remove existing natural gas-fired power plants from CO2 curbs show how Biden\u2019s administration is under industry pressure over the plans ahead of the November election. The transport and power sectors together account for half of the country\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions, but the perception of heavy-handed regulation of those industries risks hurting Biden\u2019s reelection bid against rival and former President Donald Trump.\n\nClimate researchers told Reuters they agree with official projections from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that the changes to the rules may not have much impact on the U.S. goal to halve national emissions by 2030 from 2005 levels.\n\nAmanda Levin, director of policy analysis at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the weakening of the EPA vehicle rule, for example, would still achieve at least 90% of the emissions reductions of the more stringent initial proposal, while the removal of existing gas plants from the EPA power plant rule would deliver 80% of the initial proposal.\n\nMore important to the US decarbonization target, however, is how fast developers can build zero-emissions power generation and hook it up to the grid \u2013 efforts crucial to supporting the EV fleet and which would render the power plant regulation moot. Biden is attempting to spur those industries along by using lucrative subsidies for wind, solar and electric vehicles embedded in the roughly $400 billion Inflation Reduction Act.\n\n\u201cThe EPA rules serve more as the as a backstop (to the IRA),\u201d said O\u2019Boyle.\n\nBefore the IRA passed in 2022, the U.S. was only on track to reduce its emissions 25%-28% by 2030, according to NRDC\u2019s Levin.\n\nBoth NRDC and energy consultancy the Rhodium Group found in separate analyses that the U.S. is now on track to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 42% by 2030.\n\nStill, filling the remaining gap could be tricky.\n\nBoth the U.S. solar and offshore wind manufacturing industries are pushing the Biden administration for more support, in addition to what is included in the IRA, to ensure they have the financing and economics needed to follow through with their investment plants.\n\nO\u2019Boyle and others said additional challenges include permitting and constructing transmission lines required to connect new power generation to consumers.\n\nAround 2,000 GW of mainly renewable generation and energy storage are in regional grid interconnection queues across the United States, with recent announced projects \u2013 many incentivized by the IRA\u2019s tax credits \u2013 taking upwards of five years to connect.\n\nThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Energy Department are working on reforms aimed at speeding up the interconnection backlog and expanding transmission.\n\nLevin of the NRDC said states can also help fill the gap with strengthened renewable energy targets and EV policies, especially as IRA-driven investments hit the ground from California to Texas to Pennsylvania.\n\n\u201cThat is a huge piece of the puzzle,\u201d she said.",

            "text": "A coalition of 16 Republican states, led by Texas and Louisiana, filed a lawsuit against the Biden administration, challenging its recent climate action pausing proposed energy projects.\n\nThe multistate coalition filed its complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana, listing President Biden, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm and the Department of Energy (DOE) among the defendants in the case. According to the complaint, the DOE's move earlier this year pausing major liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminal projects violated long-standing federal energy laws.\n\n\"Biden\u2019s unilateral decree disregards statutory mandates, flouts the legal process, upends the oil and gas industry, disrupts the Texas economy, and subverts our constitutional structure,\" said Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton.\n\n\"The ban will drive billions of dollars in investment away from Texas, hinder our ability to maximize revenue for public schools, force Texas producers to flare excess natural gas instead of taking it to market, and annihilate critical jobs,\" he continued. \"I will not stand by while Biden attacks Texas.\"\n\nGOP LEADERS CONFRONT BIDEN\u2019S NEW CLIMATE CZAR ON KEY SECURITY RISKS LURKING IN GREEN AGENDA\n\nAccording to Paxton, the LNG export moratorium is unconstitutional, ignores the 1938 Natural Gas Act\u2019s \"presumption in favor of exports\" and discards decades of DOE energy policy.\n\nIn arguing the alleged unconstitutionality of the policy, the states' complaint notes Article I of the Constitution vests Congress with \"[a]ll legislative Powers,\" including the power \"[t]o regulate Commerce with foreign Nations.\" Therefore, since blocking LNG exports can be considered a regulation of commerce, the DOE violated the Constitution, according to the lawsuit.\n\nTIKTOK ACTIVIST SAYS HE ADVISED WHITE HOUSE ON BIDEN'S NEW NATURAL GAS MORATORIUM\n\n\"The LNG Export Ban implicates an issue of profound national importance. LNG exports account for billions of dollars to the economy and thousands of jobs,\" the complaint states. \"They also raise serious questions of national security. And this is an issue that has been the subject of proposed legislation and public attention in and outside of Congress.\"\n\nThe complaint accuses DOE of violating the Administrative Procedure Act which governs the procedures of administrative law. The states highlight that DOE failed to host any public comment period before finalizing its LNG policy without \"good cause to forego the notice and comment requirement.\"\n\nAdditionally, the states argue the DOE failed to properly consider the Natural Gas Act and its provision that states the agency issue an export license before hearing from the public.\n\nDOZENS OF FORMER TOP FEDERAL OFFICIALS CALL ON CONGRESS TO STRIKE DOWN BIDEN'S NATURAL GAS CRACKDOWN\n\n\"The Biden administration\u2019s illegal attacks on American energy jeopardizes the livelihoods of thousands of hard-working Louisiana men and women, millions of dollars in tax revenue, and billions of dollars in infrastructure,\" said Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill.\n\n\"LNG continues to have an enormous positive economic impact for our state \u2014 especially on our hard-hit coastal communities, which continue to recover from a recent series of devastating hurricanes. Jobs like these grow the economy, reduce crime, and help address the out-migration problem,\" she continued. \"The people of Louisiana are proud to power this nation. I\u2019m ready to fight for them.\"\n\nIn a surprise move in January, Biden ordered the DOE to pause pending permits for LNG export facilities while federal officials conduct a rigorous environmental review assessing the projects' carbon emissions, which could take more than a year to complete. The action was lauded by climate activists who have loudly called for such a move, which they said would help combat global warming.\n\nHowever, the move was blasted by industry groups, former federal officials and bipartisan lawmakers, who noted energy exports are vital for aiding allies in Europe and Asia. In the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine two years ago, U.S. LNG largely filled the void left by Russian natural gas as U.S. allies sought to wean off Russian exports and punish the nation's economy, a plan Biden endorsed at the time.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",

Biden meanwhile spent $6.3 million in the month but Trump spent more \u2014 $7.8 million.\n\nThose figures however don\u2019t show the complete picture for either candidate as filings from their various fundraising committees won\u2019t be made until April.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign said at the weekend that it had raised more than $53 million in February, leaving it with a \u201chistoric\u201d total of $155 million, which it said was the most by any Democrat at this stage in the election cycle.\n\n\u2018Dumpster fire\u2019\n\nPerhaps the most worrying element for Trump are his giant legal fees, as he faces criminal cases including for trying to subvert his 2020 election loss and keeping secret documents.\n\nLawyers\u2019 bills accounted for a huge $5.6 million of the money spent in February by Trump\u2019s Save America political action committee \u2014 money that could otherwise be going towards campaigning and TV spots.\n\nThe figures add to Trump\u2019s woes as he struggles to raise a $464 million bond to appeal a fine by a New York court for fraudulently inflating his wealth.\n\nThe 77-year-old now faces having his assets seized in a humiliating blow to his carefully cultivated image as a dealmaker and self-made tycoon.\n\nTrump cast the fraud case as a \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d seeking as he often does to use the legal cases against him to whip up his supporters \u2014 and get them to open their wallets.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m calling on ONE MILLION Pro-Trump patriots to chip in and say: STOP THE WITCH HUNT AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP!\u201d a campaign message on Wednesday said.\n\nThe message was titled \u201cKEEP YOUR FILTHY HANDS OFF TRUMP TOWER,\u201d his flagship New York property that could be at risk from the court case.\n\nEarlier this month Trump managed to put together a separate bond for $91.6 million as he appeals a sexual assault and defamation judgment in a lawsuit brought by New York writer E. Jean Carroll.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign described Trump\u2019s finances as a \u201cdumpster fire.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s filings paint a bleak picture for Republicans,\u201d Biden campaign spokesman Ammar Moussa wrote on Thursday.\n\nBut with a tight election looming and Trump leading Biden in key swing states in recent polls, Democrats will be trying to keep their war chest as full as possible.\n\nBiden will be joined at a fundraiser in New York on March 28 by Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, the first event of its kind to feature three Democratic presidents and among the most lucrative in party history.\n\nThe gala show is set to raise $10 million for Biden\u2019s campaign, with guests having to fork out $100,000 each to pose in a photo with the 42nd, 44th and 46th US presidents, NBC News reported.",

And, get this, ol' Evan was once appointed by America's # 1 Terrorist Leader and threat to our national security as a member of the U.S. government's Advisory Committee For Trade Policy And Negotiations in October of 2018. I guess Chubb wanted in on some of the rape, fraud, and treason action.\n\nWe all know our government moves slowly as it wades through all the technicalities, both legal and political, but, in an apparent house cleaning move, Joe Biden showed Trump's buddy the door in March of 2023. Oh and here's another amusing little factoid: Greenberg, a college dropout, got his first job at Chubb from his daddy. Kinda makes him a ton like Don Jr. and Eric, don't it. Now all I need to know is whether Greenberg's IQ matches the combined IQ of those two, or not.\n\n\n\n",

            "text": "Rows of photovoltaic panels are seen in a national renewable energy demonstration zone in Zhangjiakou, Hebei province, on Aug. 18, 2023. [Photo/Xinhua]\n\nClimate change is a common challenge facing all of mankind. As the world's largest developing country, China is not only a victim of climate change, but also an active participant in and important contributor to global climate governance.\n\n\n\nChina was among the first countries to sign the Paris Agreement. On the morning of Sept. 3, 2016, before the opening of the 2016 G20 Summit in Hangzhou, the Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress approved China's accession to the agreement. In Hangzhou, then-United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon commended China's action, saying that by formally joining the Paris Agreement, China added \"powerful momentum to the drive for the agreement to enter into force\" in that year.\n\nAlthough former U.S. President Donald Trump announced on June 1, 2017 that the United States would withdraw from the Paris Agreement, China still adheres to its commitments and has helped the agreement achieve stability and long-term implementation.\n\nChina has made vigorous efforts to achieve peak carbon emissions and carbon neutrality. On Sept. 22, 2020, China announced at the U.N. General Assembly that it would increase its nationally determined contributions, adopt more powerful policies and measures, strive to peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. In fact, reaching this goal is a major strategic decision made by China. It is not only an inevitable choice for China in solving its own problems related to resources and environmental constraints, but also a solemn commitment to pushing for global climate governance and building a community with a shared future for mankind.\n\nGlobal climate governance involves the interests of all parties. Whether the international negotiations on climate change can proceed smoothly depends on all the countries of the world. As a result, it is a complicated issue that requires consultation, conciliation as well as bargaining among all the state and non-state actors. China has been actively participating in all international negotiations on climate change, while adhering to the principles of fairness, \"common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities,\" and respecting the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Kyoto Protocol and the Montreal Protocol.\n\nIn fact, China has promoted the establishment of multilateral consultation mechanisms such as the BASIC Ministerial Meeting on Climate Change and coordinated the negotiation positions of major developing countries so as to safeguard the interests and unity of all developing countries.\n\nThe effectiveness of global climate governance is partly determined by the capacity for financing all of the actions for dealing with climate change. As one of the world's largest emerging economies, China has been offering financial assistance to other developing countries, particularly the small island countries, African countries and the least developed countries. In promoting cooperation, China wishes to adhere to the concept that \"it is better to teach someone how to fish rather than give them a fish\" within the framework of South-South cooperation.\n\nAt the 2018 Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, for instance, China pledged to further strengthen cooperation with African countries in the fields of ecological and environmental protection. These include areas such as responding to climate change, using clean energy, preventing and controlling soil desertification and soil erosion, and protecting wild animals and plants, so as to turn China and Africa into a beautiful homeland where man and nature live in harmony.\n\nIt is estimated that, from 2011 to 2021, China allocated approximately 1.2 billion yuan for South-South cooperation to strengthen climate change mitigation and adaptation. Moreover, it signed 40 cooperation documents with 35 countries. China's assistance covers many areas, including launching meteorological satellites, building photovoltaic power generation systems and lighting equipment, manufacturing new energy vehicles, environmental monitoring equipment, clean stoves and other climate change-related goods, and establishing low-carbon demonstration zones. At the same time, around 2,000 officials and technicians from nearly 120 developing countries have visited China for climate change training.\n\nIn stark contrast to the United States' announcement that it would withdraw from the Paris Agreement, Chinese leaders have reiterated China's global climate governance proposition on numerous occasions, sending powerful signals of determination and courage to the world. Meanwhile, China has also repeatedly called upon the world to strengthen unity and cooperation to deal with climate change and adhere to multilateralism, safeguard the international system and international law.\n\nGlobal climate governance is a long-term endeavor that will clearly not be completed within the foreseeable future. However, China will continue to contribute toward making it a reality.\n\nThe author is a distinguished professor at Macao University of Science and Technology.\n\nOpinion articles reflect the views of their authors, not necessarily those of China.org.cn.\n\n",

            "text": "WASHINGTON\u2014Donald Trump crushed his opponents in nearly every Republican primary this year. But when it comes to the money race, President Biden has a big head start on his predecessor.\n\nIn February, Biden\u2019s campaign apparatus said it brought in more than $53 million, leaving it with more than $155 million on hand at the end of the month. Trump\u2019s operation by comparison reported raising $39.3 million\u2014with $74.4 million in the bank\u2014across his campaign committee, the Republican National Committee, a supportive super PAC and a leadership PAC, which has been drained by shelling out more than $53 million in legal-related expenses since early last year.\n\nAs the general election begins in earnest, the new figures underscore how much financial ground the former president has to make up on his likely Democratic challenger\u2014money used for pricey TV ads, campaign staff, office space, consulting fees and other expenses.\n\nView Full Image Graphic: WSJ\n\nTrump has retained a slight advantage in polls in battleground states, where thin margins will likely decide who wins the presidency in November. Money also doesn\u2019t necessarily equal guaranteed victory; Hillary Clinton bested Trump in the 2016 money race but still lost the White House. And Trump\u2019s fundraising is likely to pick up now that he has replaced the leadership at the RNC and formed a joint-fundraising committee.\n\nNonetheless, Biden\u2019s fundraising advantage lays bare the risks that Trump has going into spring and summer, when he\u2019ll accept his party\u2019s nomination at the Republican National Convention. His financial health might also reflect the segment of Republicans who say they\u2019ll refuse to vote for Trump even if he were the nominee, according to surveys of GOP primary voters by AP VoteCast.\n\nWhile the Biden team reported adding $25 million to its total cash holdings in February, Trump\u2019s cash\u2014across the campaign account, the RNC and two PACs\u2014increased by $9.2 million. The former president\u2019s February numbers include transfers from his Trump Save America Joint Fundraising Committee, which won\u2019t provide updated figures until it files next month.\n\nTrump\u2019s leadership PAC, Save America, spent $2.2 million more than it took in during February, lowering its cash on hand to $4.1 million at the end of the month. Among its expenditures during February: $1.3 million for research, $1.6 million on payroll and at least $1 million on data processing, according to new data from the Federal Election Commission.\n\nBiden and Trump have spent nearly identical amounts on advertising so far this year, according to data from AdImpact. From Jan. 1 through March 19, Biden\u2019s campaign and his joint fundraising committee had run $13.2 million in television, radio, satellite and online ads, compared with $13.3 million for Trump and his top allied committee.\n\nYet there\u2019s one key difference: Biden has been working to target general-election voters all year, while the bulk of the spending associated with Trump was to mobilize primary voters before he became the presumptive nominee. Biden\u2019s campaign also launched a six-week, $30 million ad blitz in swing states shortly after his March 7 State of the Union address.\n\nOther candidates\u2019 financial pictures have paled in comparison now that Trump and Biden have enough delegates to win their respective parties\u2019 nominations.\n\nIndependent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.reported raising $3.2 million in February, raising his cash on hand at the end of the month to $5.1 million. About 39% of his contributions came from small-dollar donors who have given $200 or less during the presidential cycle.\n\nJohn McCormick contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Jack Gillum at jack.gillum@wsj.com and Anthony DeBarros at anthony.debarros@wsj.com",

James Comer, pushed forward at Wednesday\u2019s public listening to, claiming that the Democratic president was both \u201ccomplicit\u201d in his son Hunter Biden\u2019s enterprise dealings promoting the Biden model or \u201cincompetent\u201d within the household funds.\n\nHowever Comer has additionally signaled an curiosity in taking the inquiry into one other route, stopping in need of drawing up articles of impeachment towards the president and eyeing potential prison referrals of alleged Biden household wrongdoing to the Justice Division for attainable prosecution.\n\nWith Hunter Biden declining to look on the listening to after having testified privately final month, Comer stated earlier on Fox Information that there could be \u201ca number of\u201d prison referrals. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to finish nicely for the Bidens,\u201d the Kentucky lawmaker stated.\n\nIt\u2019s the beginning of a possible winding down for the prolonged GOP-led probe that was launched after Republicans seized management of the Home in January and had been keen to carry Biden to the excessive bar of impeachment.

Tony Bobulinski, a onetime enterprise affiliate of Hunter Biden, took his claims towards the household public in the course of the first Trump-Biden presidential debate in 2020.\n\nThe Democrats referred to as Lev Parnas to testify, counting on the convicted businessman who was central to Trump\u2019s first impeachment as a Rudy Giuliani affiliate working to dig up political filth on Joe Biden earlier than the 2020 election. Parnas has since performed a key function in dispelling the Home GOP\u2019s major declare of bribery towards the Bidens.\n\nTestifying by way of video, Galanis instructed lawmakers he anticipated to make \u201cbillions\u201d with Hunter Biden and different associates, utilizing the Biden household title of their international enterprise dealings.\n\nGalanis described a selected time in Might 2014 when Hunter Biden put his father on speakerphone for a short chat with potential international enterprise companions \u2014 a Russian oligarch and her husband \u2014 throughout a celebration at a New York restaurant.\n\nIn earlier testimony Galanis, who was sentenced for a number of fraud schemes, acknowledged that he unsuccessfully sought a pardon within the last days of the Trump presidency.\n\nHunter Biden, in his personal deposition final month, testified he met Galanis for about half-hour 10 years in the past.\n\nBobulinski instructed the committee that he met twice with Joe Biden in 2017 throughout a convention in Los Angeles, by way of Hunter Biden, together with as soon as for 45 minutes.\n\nWhereas Hunter Biden has testified that his father was by no means concerned in his enterprise dealings, Bobulinski declared that \u201cblatant lies.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear to me that Joe Biden was the model,\u201d Bobulinksi stated.\n\nParnas instructed the committee that in all his work abroad, he has seen \u201czero proof\u201d of Biden household corruption.\n\nEarlier than his personal conviction, Parnas had been a central determine in Trump\u2019s first impeachment over withholding help to Ukraine.\n\nParnas described serving to Giuliani peddle the false claims to conservative media.

The now former FBI informant, Alexander Smirnov, was arrested final month and pleaded not responsible to fees that he fabricated the bribery allegations.\n\nParnas instructed the committee that lawmakers knew the knowledge was unverified. Final summer season, he had despatched Comer a prolonged later dispelling these claims, saying it was all speak and the cash was not paid to the Bidens.\n\nWith the Home\u2019s slim GOP majority narrowed additional by early retirements, Republicans might not have sufficient assist inside their ranks to pursue articles of impeachment towards the president, particularly as a result of Democrats would seemingly vote towards any such fees.\n\nAs a substitute, Comer has been wanting into potential prison referrals to the Justice Division, which might seemingly be symbolic however may open the door to prosecutions in a future administration.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear who would precisely be charged, and over what offenses.

            "text": "A recent development in the highly contentious Georgia 2020 election interference case has granted former President Donald Trump and other defendants the right to appeal a decision that would allow Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis to remain on the prosecution team. Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee\u2019s determination opens the door for the defense to seek review from the Georgia Court of Appeals regarding whether Willis should be disqualified because of her romantic relationship with a special prosecutor on the case, Nathan Wade.\n\nThe backstory of this legal entanglement is rooted in the accusations against Trump and 18 others of attempting to unlawfully overturn his slim defeat to Joe Biden in the 2020 Georgia presidential election. A recorded phone call from January 2, 2021, exemplifies the charges, capturing Trump pressing Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to \u201cfind\u201d enough votes to secure his victory.\n\nWhile Judge McAfee ruled that Willis could maintain her prosecutorial position given Wade\u2019s resignation, which took effect last Friday, the defense claims that Willis\u2019s continuation presents an impermissible appearance of impropriety that could jeopardize any future convictions. Trump\u2019s attorney, Steve Sadow, underscored the gravity of the judge\u2019s consent to appeal, stating, \u201cThe defense is optimistic that appellate review will lead to the case being dismissed and the DA being disqualified.\u201d Despite these proceedings, the trial preparations move forward, as Judge McAfee indicated he would continue addressing other pending matters.\n\nTrump\u2019s defense teams have accused Willis of financial impropriety, alleging she paid Wade substantial sums for his work on the case, then benefited personally when he spent part of those earnings on vacations for them both. Both Willis and Wade deny any wrongdoing, asserting their romantic involvement began only after Wade\u2019s appointment as special prosecutor and concluded in the summer of 2023. Following the controversy, Wade tendered his resignation to expedite the case, an act Willis commended for its dedication to the American public and the democratic process.\n\nThe former president, who has entered a not guilty plea and vehemently denied any misconduct, sees the litany of cases against him as a concerted effort to undermine his potential 2024 presidential campaign. As Trump and his associates seek to challenge McAfee\u2019s ruling in a higher court, they contend that the disclosed romantic relationship undermines the integrity of the prosecution, requiring Willis\u2019s dismissal or at least the disqualification of her entire office.\n\nThe stakes of the appellate decision are substantial, affecting the defendants\u2019 due process rights and potentially requiring retrials should errors be identified later. With the defense\u2019s motion for appeal highlighting the \u201cappearance of impropriety\u201d and \u201codor of mendacity\u201d referenced by McAfee, the legal battle promises to persist as a pivotal and polarizing episode in the larger narrative of the 2020 election aftermath.\n\nRelevant articles:\n\n\u2013 Judge clears way for Trump to appeal ruling keeping Fani Willis on Georgia 2020 election case\n\n\u2013 Judge allows Trump and co-defendants to appeal order letting Fani Willis continue on 2020 election case, CNN, Wed, 20 Mar 2024 15:57:00 GMT\n\n\u2013 Georgia judge allows Trump to appeal Fani Willis disqualification ruling, The Hill, Wed, 20 Mar 2024 16:11:00 GMT\n\n\u2013 Judge grants Trump request to appeal decision to keep Fani Willis on Georgia case, The Washington Post, Wed, 20 Mar 2024 20:02:00 GMT\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

            "text": "ST. LOUIS - SUV driver Darlene Wilson unexpectedly found herself behind the steering wheel of a Tesla electric car after someone crashed into her family's Chevrolet Traverse.\n\nDriving hundreds of miles a week, with two kids to haul around while also managing an Airbnb, Wilson appreciated the Traverse's space. But filling up every other day had gotten old \u2012 and expensive.\n\nAnd now, after a few weeks of driving the insurance-paid rental Tesla, Wilson, 41, is a convert to electric vehicles, or at least this specific one.\n\n\"We love it. And I didn\u2019t think we were going to,\" said Wilson as her two kids watched videos and played games on the car's large display screen, the Tesla charging behind a Target store.\n\nWhile many Tesla owners have installed chargers at their homes, Wilson has to use company-branded chargers that take about 30 minutes to refill the car's batteries. Still, she said, even having to sit parked a few times a week is far cheaper than filling her SUV's 20-gallon tank, and she's now considering buying an EV herself.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\n\u201cI would drive it because it\u2019s more economical,\" she said. \"For what we spent on gas compared to what it costs to charge, it\u2019s not even close.\"\n\nFor Wilson, driving an electric car isn't a political decision, just straight-up economics. But increasingly for Americans, President Joe Biden and rival Donald Trump are putting EV drivers and their haters squarely in the political spotlight.\n\nEVs could reshape American travel, economy\n\nAnd as they move closer to mainstream, EVs have become the latest culture war flashpoint between Republicans and Democrats, with Biden pushing heavily for their adoption and Trump promising a \u201cbloodbath\u201d of regulatory restrictions to block imports and protect American auto workers, many of whom are based in the swing state of Michigan. Because EVs have fewer parts, they require less work to build and maintain.\n\nReading deeper:A possible solution to a common problem with EVs: Just rewire your brain\n\nThe battle over EV adoption has high stakes, with experts warning the U.S. needs to move rapidly away from gas-burning vehicles in order to meet goals set by the Paris Climate Accords and help blunt the impacts of an already-changing climate.\n\nToday, there are about 4.5 million plug-in hybrids and EVs on American roads, representing about 10% of all vehicles. About 1/3 of all EVs are in California.\n\nAlthough electric vehicles have been adopted more rapidly around the world \u2012 including in Norway, China and the European Union \u2012 Americans have been slow to shift their purchases. Last year, the top three vehicle models sold in the U.S. were pickups, followed by the Toyota RAV4. But the fifth-best selling vehicle, according to estimates by Motor1, was the battery-powered Tesla Model Y SUV.\n\nThe Biden administration on Wednesday issued new rules aimed at shifting drivers away from buying gasoline cars and SUVs.\n\nThe new rules, based around tailpipe emission standards, are intended to ensure that within eight years, the majority of consumer vehicles sold are either all-electric or gas-electric hybrids. The rules don't require manufacturers to make EVs, but the emission standards are so tough that automakers will have a hard time complying unless they do. Last year, about 16% of new vehicles sold were EVs or hybrids, according to federal officials.\n\nWhile Biden and other EV fans say electric cars are widely beneficial for both drivers and the climate, critics complain that EVs are more expensive, slow to recharge, have smaller ranges, especially in cold weather, and that the charging infrastructure is spotty.\n\nTo help lower costs, the Biden administration offers tax breaks to buy American-made EVs, and is spending more than $7.5 billion to build rapid-charging stations across the country, especially along heavily traveled interstate corridors.\n\nIn a statement distributed by the Biden administration, an industry group that represents most of the major auto manufacturers \u2012 including Ford, GM, Honda and Stellantis, the parent company that makes Dodge, Chrysler and Jeep vehicles \u2012 said the push toward EVs is both necessary and challenging. The group thanked Biden for delaying the start of the emission standards for several years, allowing charging infrastructure and supply chains to develop.\n\n\"The future is electric,\" said John Bozzella, the president and CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation. \"Consumers have tons of choices. But pace matters.\"\n\nWhile some EV critics say they just don't want to be forced into driving a battery-powered car, others have a far more visceral reaction. Across the country, there's been news reports of gas-vehicle drivers deliberately blocking off EV charging stations in what's known as \"ICEing,\" a reference to their internal combustion engine.\n\nEVs help fight climate change, reduce greenhouse gas\n\nThe transportation sector is the single-largest producer of climate-changing carbon dioxide emissions, largely because the vast majority of vehicles are powered either directly or indirectly by burning coal, natural gas or gasoline. Wind, solar and hydro make up about 20% of the nation's electricity generation, although that number is rising rapidly each year, according to federal officials.\n\nA 2023 study published by the journal Transportation Research found that about 25% of EV purchasers ultimately replaced them with a gas-powered vehicle, while another 10% bought a plug-in hybrid because they typically have a longer range. The study noted, however, that Tesla purchasers almost invariably bought another Tesla. Experts say \"range anxiety\" is one of the single-biggest stumbling blocks for widespread EV adoption, which is what's driving the Biden administration push for more changing stations.\n\nTesla driver Topher Clark, 54, doesn't understand how trying to protect the Earth became so political. He sees his Tesla, along with the solar panels on the roof of his Portland, Oregon, home, as one part of a reasonable effort to reduce pollution and fight climate change.\n\n\u201cThis was the realization of a lifelong dream to not be spewing exhaust,\" said Clark, a software engineering manager, gesturing at his Tesla SUV charging near the junction of I-64 and I-170.\n\nClark, 54, was driving cross-country \u2012 he'd already put 2,000 miles behind him \u2012 and said charging was easy and convenient. Clark said after buying the Tesla, he practiced driving it increasingly long distances from Portland to ensure the SUV's miles-left estimates were accurate. He was especially worried about losing capacity in cold weather, but said the SUV's computer made it \"brain-dead easy\" to travel from charger to charger.\n\nHe also said he's frustrated that caring for the Earth is somehow a partisan issue.\n\n\"There\u2019s nothing political about keeping your house clean,\" he said. \"I can't look my nieces and nephews in their eyes, tell them I love them and then piss on the planet. And that's effectively what's people are doing.\"\n\nAnd Matthew Fisher, CEO of Gridspot, said he was shocked by the comments he got after advertising his company's app, which allows people with EV chargers to rent them out to drivers who are in the neighborhood. Fisher said he paid for 10,000 Facebook advertising impressions and got 10 comments back \u2012 nine of which were negative.\n\n\"That was not what I expected,\" said Fisher. \"The arguments get really bizarre.\"\n\nFisher said the Facebook advertising stats showed him that most of the people who saw his ads were older white men, who tend to be more conservative than the overall U.S. population. Still, he said, he was surprised at how vitriolic the comments got. That suggests to him that objections to EVs are inherently illogical.\n\n\"It was just this sentiment that 'you take my emissions, you take my freedom,'\" he said. \"It\u2019s mind-boggling.\"\n\nEVs represent a new front in the culture wars\n\nIn December 2023, Trump posted a social-media message that in part said supporters of an \"all electric car lunacy\" should \"rot in Hell.\" He previously warned that foreign competitors would ruin the U.S. auto manufacturing industry, costing tens of thousands of jobs. Other EV critics point out that the vast majority of EV batteries are sourced from China, and that the batteries themselves are filled with rare-earth minerals extracted at great environmental cost.\n\nThe Trump-affiliated America First Policy Institute contends the new emissions standards issued Wednesday would cost the country about 117,000 jobs because EVs require less work to assemble, with the losses particularly acute in Michigan. But the United Auto Workers union endorsed Biden over Trump in January, after Biden visited union workers picketing automakers last year.\n\nThose union workers were striking, in part, at Ford, GM and Stellantis plants over the fact that some new workers in EV-focused plants were being paid less than longtime union workers on the gasoline-vehicle production lines. Many EVs, especially those made by Tesla, are built by non-union workers. More than 1 million Americans work in the auto-manufacturing industry, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nAlthough the new emissions standards don't specifically force auto manufacturers to start making EVs, they have that practical effect.\n\nIn a statement, companies representing truck stops and travel centers, convenience stores and gas stations said they support efforts to lower emissions caused by vehicles. But it said consumer choice, not government mandate, should drive change. The groups said it wants the Biden administration to create an environment where retailers like them can be assured of earning profits by installing charging stations.\n\n\"The fastest, most efficient way to lower carbon emissions remains through technology-neutral, market- oriented, consumer-focused policies that encourage all fueling technologies to improve their respective emissions,\" said the groups, which sell about 90% of the country's gasoline. \"This rule does not do that. Instead, it functions as an effective mandate for a single technology that at this point has not proven itself to be more viable than other compelling solutions.\"\n\nAnd the National Automobile Dealers Association, which declared that \"dealers are all-in on EVs,\" said dealerships are worried the new Biden EPA rules go too far, too fast, opening the door for Chinese companies to leapfrog ahead of U.S.-based manufacturers. Many American-built EVs qualify for a $7,500 tax credit, but many Chinese EVs are significantly cheaper to begin with. One of the best-selling Chinese-made EVs sells for about $17,000, but is not available in the United States in part due to a 25% tariff on Chinese-made EVs Trump implemented and Biden has maintained.\n\n\"Consumers will dictate the pace of EV adoption, not lawmakers, regulators or (automakers),\" NADA said. \"Public policy should be focused on turning over the combustion fleet, getting consumers used to charging and getting cleaner vehicles on the road \u2013 including plug-in hybrids.\"\n\nMany automakers have scaled back predictions for EV sales in the past several months due to slowing demand, including Ford, which in January announced it would halt one of two production lines for its F150 Lightning EV pickup, and move some of the workers to lines making gas-powered pickups.\n\nAt the charging station in St. Louis, Wilson, the accidental Tesla driver, said she didn't think the politicization of EVs was necessarily helpful to the country. She said people should just buy what works for them. And she encouraged other skeptics to try out Teslas, which start at about $40,000.\n\n\"We want to buy one now,\" she said, laughing. \"It's smooth. And it\u2019s fast. Really fast.\"",
